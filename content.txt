money which may from time to time be due from any
member in respect of his shares, nor any indulgence that
may be granted by the Company in respect of payment
of any such money, shall preclude the Company from
thereafter proceeding to enforce a forfeiture in respect of
such shares as herein provided. Such forfeiture shall
include all dividends declared or any other moneys payable

before the forfeiture.
Receipt of part

be invalidated by any omission or neglect or any failure to
give such notice or make such entry as aforesaid.
Entry of forfeiture
in register of
members

of forfeiture, of all interest in and all claims and demands

rights incidental to the share.

Board thinks fit.

Company for every 100 equity shares of Rs.10/- each, of the Second Transferor Company.
(c) For the purpose as aforesaid, the Transferee Company shall, if and to the extent required, apply for and obtain any
approval of regulatory authorities as needed.
11. Upon this Scheme becoming finally effective, all the shareholders of the Transferor Companies if so required by the Transferee
Company shall surrender their share certificates for cancellation thereof to the Transferee Company. Notwithstanding anything to
the contrary, upon the new shares in the Transferee Company being issued and allotted by it to the shareholders of the Transferor
Companies whose names shall appear on the Register of Members of the Transferor Companies on such Record Date fixed as
aforesaid, the share certificates in relation to the shares held by them in the Transferor Companies shall be deemed to have been
automatically cancelled and be of no effect, on and from such Record Date, and the Transferee Company may instead of requiring
the surrender of the share certificates, as above, directly issue and despatch the new share certificates of the Transferee Company
in lieu thereof.
12. (a) The Transferor Companies and the Transferee Company shall be entitled to declare and pay dividends to their respective
shareholders for any Financial Year or any period prior to the Effective Date. The Transferor Companies shall obtain the

Company shall declare dividends only out of disposable profits, earned by the respective companies during that year and
shall not transfer any amount from the reserves for the purpose of payment of dividend.
77
(b) Notwithstanding anything in the Articles of Association to the contrary, the Equity Shares of the Transferee Company to be
issued and allotted to the shareholders of the Transferor Companies as the case may be as provided in Clause 10 hereof
shall rank pari passu in all respects with the then existing equity shares of the Transferee Company and shall also carry
proportionate entitlement to dividend for the period from 1st January 1995 to 31st March, 1995 and thereafter on the same
basis as the existing shareholders of the Transferee Company are entitled to. The holders of the shares of the Transferor
Companies and the Transferee Company shall, save as expressly provided otherwise in this Scheme, continue to enjoy
their existing rights under their respective Articles of Association including the right to receive dividends from the respective
companies of which they are members till the date this Scheme finally takes effect i.e. the Effective Date.
(c) It is clarified, however, that the aforesaid provisions in respect of declaration of dividend are enabling provisions only
and shall not be deemed to confer any right on any member of the Transferor Companies or the Transferee Company to
demand or claim any dividend which subject to the provisions of the said Act, shall be entirely at the discretion of the Board
of Directors and the approval of the Shareholders of the respective companies.
13. The calls-in-arrears in respect of the shares issued by the Transferor Companies shall upon the Scheme being finally effective,
continue to be outstanding obligations from the respective members of the Transferor Companies to the Transferee Company to
the full extent of all the amount in arrears together with any interest which is payable thereon in accordance with the provisions
of the Articles of Association of the Transferee Company as if they were the Articles of Association of the Transferor Companies.
The Transferee Company shall be entitled to reserve the allotment in respect of such shares and/or keep in abeyance the
issuance of the share certificates in the Transferee Company to be issued in exchange of the share certificates in the Transferor
Companies where such calls are in arrears. During the period that such shares are reserved and/or kept in abeyance as aforesaid,
the holder of such shares in the Transferor Company shall not be regarded as a member of the Transferee Company in any respect
and consequently not entitled to any dividends, rights, bonus or other benefits declared or paid during the period prior to such
holder becoming a member of the Transferee Company in respect of such shares. For the removal of doubt, it is clarified that the
Transferee Company shall also be entitled to forfeit such shares in respect of which such calls are in arrears in accordance with
the provisions of the Articles of Association of the Transferee Company as if they were the Articles of Association of the Transferor
Companies.
14. (a) All employees of the Transferor Companies in service on the date immediately preceding the date on which this Scheme
finally takes effect i.e. the Effective Date shall become the employees of the Transferee Company on such date without any
break or interruption in service and on the terms and conditions not less favourable than those subsisting with reference
to the Transferor Companies as the case may be on the said date. The position, rank and designation of the employees of
the Transferor Companies would be decided by the Transferee Company.
(b) It is expressly provided that as far as the Provident Fund, Gratuity Fund, Superannuation Fund or any other Special
Fund created or existing for the benefit of the employees of the Transferor Companies are concerned, upon the Scheme
becoming finally effective, the Transferee Company shall stand substituted for the Transferor Companies for all purposes
whatsoever related to the administration or operation of such Schemes or Funds or in relation to the obligation to make
contributions to the said Funds in accordance with the provisions of such Schemes, Funds as per the terms provided in
the respective Trust Deeds. It is the end and intent that all the rights, duties, powers and obligations of the Transferor
Companies in relation to such Funds shall become those of the Transferee Company. It is clarified that the services of the
employees of the Transferor Companies will be treated as having been continued for the purpose of the aforesaid Funds
or provisions.

Company to “Miscellaneous Expenditure (to the extent not written off or adjusted) - RPPL Account” and “Miscellaneous Expenditure
(to the extent not written off or adjusted) - RPEL Account” respectively and the same shall thereafter be dealt with in the same
manner as they would have been, had they been incurred by the Transferee Company.
16. (a) Subject to the provisions of Clause 15 above, the excess of the value of the net assets of the Transferor Companies
and (which shall include the balance under the heads of “Miscellaneous Expenditure” mentioned in Clause 15 above) as
appearing in the books of account of both the First Transferor Company and the Second Transferor Company over the
paid-up value of the shares to be issued and allotted pursuant to the terms of Clause 10 above, shall be accounted for and
dealt with in the books of the Transferee Company as follows:-
(i) An amount equal to the combined balance lying to the credit of the Share Premium Account in the books of
account of the First Transferor Company and the Second Transferor Company respectively shall be credited by
the Transferee Company to an account styled as “Share Premium Account”. The said account shall be considered
as a free reserve and shall form part of the net worth of the Transferee Company.
(ii) An amount equal to the combined balance lying to the credit of the General Reserve in the books of account of the
First Transferor Company and the Second Transferor Company respectively shall be credited by the Transferee
Company to its General Reserve and shall constitute the Transferee Company’s free reserve as effectively as if the
same were created by the Transferee Company out of its own earned and distributable profits.
(iii) An amount equal to the combined balance lying to the credit of Revaluation Reserve in the books of account of
the Transferor Companies respectively shall be credited by the Transferee Company to an account to be styled as

(iv) An amount equal to the combined balance lying to the credit of “Profit and Loss Account” in the books of
account of the Transferor Companies respectively shall be credited by the Transferee Company to its Profit

were created by the Transferee Company out of its own earned and distributable profits.
(v) The balance shall be credited by the Transferee Company to an account to be styled as “Amalgamation Reserve
Account”. The said account shall be considered as a free reserve and shall form part of the net worth of the
Transferee Company.

(b) Equity shareholding, if any, of the Transferee Company in the Transferor Companies and to the extent that there are intercompany loans, deposits or balances as between the Transferor Companies and the Transferee Company, the obligations
in respect thereof shall come to an end and corresponding effect shall be given in the books of account and records of the
Transferee Company for the reduction of any assets or liabilities as the case may be. For the removal of doubt, it is clarified
that in view of the above there would be no accrual of interest or other charges in respect of any such inter-company loans,
deposits or balances.

14. Equity shares of the Transferee Company issued in terms of this Scheme shall be listed on the relevant stock exchange/s in India,
only where the existing equity shares of the Transferee Company are presently listed.
15. Upon the coming into effect of this Scheme, and the issue of shares in the Share Exchange Ratio by the Transferee Company
pursuant to the provisions of this Scheme, the Transferee Company shall instruct its depository (the “Depository”) in respect of
the existing global depository receipts (the “GDRs”) of the Transferee Company to issue GDRs of the Transferee Company to the
existing GDR holders of the Transferor Company in an appropriate manner, in accordance with the terms of the deposit agreement
entered into amongst the Transferee Company, the Bank of New York and all registered holders of and beneficial owners from time
to time of the GDRs of the Transferee Company (the “Deposit Agreement”). The Transferee Company and the Depository shall
enter into such further documents as may be necessary and appropriate in this behalf, which shall contain all detailed terms and
conditions of such issue.
16. The Transferee Company shall take all such steps and do all such acts, deeds and things as may be necessary for the issue
of GDRs pursuant to Clause 15, for listing the GDRs on the Luxembourg Stock Exchange and, if deemed necessary, for the
registration of the GDRs under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, of the United States of America (the “Securities Act”) on
Form F-6.
17. The GDRs issued to the existing GDR holders of the Transferor Company pursuant to Clause 15 shall be similar in all material
respects with the existing GDRs of the Transferee Company.
18. The equity shares underlying the GDRs issued to the existing GDR holders of the Transferor Company will not be registered under
the Securities Act in reliance upon the exemption from registration contained in Section 3(a)(10) of the Securities Act. To obtain
this exemption, the Transferee Company will rely on the approval of the Scheme by the High Court of Gujarat at Ahmedabad and
the High Court of Maharashtra at Mumbai following the hearing by each court. However the GDRs to be issued will be, if deemed
necessary, registered on Form F-6, as required by the Securities Act.
19. If, on account of the Share Exchange Ratio, fractional GDRs of the Transferee Company have to be issued, then, in accordance with
Section 4.03 of the Deposit Agreement, in lieu of delivering receipts for fractional GDRs the Depository may, in its discretion, sell the
shares represented by the aggregate of such fractions, at public or private sale, at such place or places and at such price or prices
as it may deem proper, and distribute the net proceeds of any such sale in accordance with the terms of the Deposit Agreement.

 CORAM : SMT. NISHITA MHATRE, J.
 DATED : 9TH DECEMBER 2005.
P.C.:
1. This Company Petition has been filed for sanction of the Scheme of Arrangement between Reliance Industries Limited - the Petitioner
Company and four other Companies, namely (1) Reliance Energy Ventures Limited, (2) Global Fuel Management Services Limited,
(3) Reliance Capital Ventures Limited and (4) Reliance Communication Ventures Limited.
2. The Petitioner Company is engaged in various businesses including (i) petrochemicals; (ii) refining; (iii) oil and gas; (iv) textiles; (v)
coal based power generation; (vi) gas based power generation; (vii) financial services business including insurance business and
(viii) telecommunications. The Petitioner Company has proposed a Scheme of Arrangement whereby the share capital and the
Assets of the Company relatable to the Divisions dealing with (i) coal based power generation i.e. Coal Based Energy Undertaking;
(ii) Gas based power generation i.e. Gas Based Energy Undertaking; (iii) Financial services including Insurance i.e. Financial
Services Undertaking and (iv) Wireless & Wireline Telecommunication Services i.e. Telecommunication Undertaking will be diverted
to the aforesaid four Companies which are the Resulting Companies. These Companies are presently wholly owned subsidiaries of
the Petitioner Company. The Petitioner Company has proposed a Scheme of Arrangement whereby each resulting Company would
issue shares after which the resulting Companies will cease to be subsidiaries of the Petitioner Company. The Petitioner Company
has proposed the demerger of its Coal Based Energy Undertaking, Gas Based Energy Undertaking, Financial Services Undertaking
and Telecommunication Undertaking under the Scheme of Arrangement to be effected under Sections 391 to 394 of the Companies
Act, 1956. According to the Petitioner Company, the demerger complies with the provisions of Section 2(19AA) of the Income Tax
Act, 1961. The salient features of the Scheme are as follows:
(i) All the properties of the Demerged Undertakings transferred by the Petitioner Company immediately before the demerger
become the properties of the respective Resulting Companies by virtue of the demerger;
(ii) All the liabilities relatable to the Demerged Undertakings being transferred by the Petitioner Company, immediately before
the demerger becomes the liabilities of the respective Resulting Companies by virtue of the demerger;
}
90
(iii) The properties and liabilities, if any, relatable to the Demerged Undertakings being transferred by the Petitioner Company are
transferred to the respective Resulting Companies at the values appearing in the books of account of the Petitioner Company
immediately before the demerger;
(iv) Each of the Resulting Companies issues shares to the shareholders of the Petitioner Company (except certain Specified
Shareholders) in consideration of the demerger on a proportionate basis;
(v) All shareholders of the Petitioner Company (except certain Specified Shareholders) shall become the shareholders of each
of the Resulting Companies by virtue of the demerger; and
(vi) The transfer of the Demerged Undertakings will be on a going concern basis.
3. By an Order of 16th September 2005 passed in the Company Application No.563 of 2005, requisite directions were issued by
this Court to convene separate meetings of its equity shareholders (except certain Specified Shareholders), secured Creditors
(including debenture holders) and unsecured creditors. These meetings were to be convened under the Chairmanship of an
independent person. Separate meetings of the equity shareholders, secured creditors and unsecured creditors were accordingly
held on 21st October 2005. The Chairman’s Reports of the meetings are annexed to the Petition. The Resolution accepting the
Scheme of Arrangement between the Petitioner Company and its four wholly owned subsidiaries i.e. the aforesaid Undertakings
into four separate companies was approved by equity shareholders constituting 99.81% of the members present and voting.
These members who voted in favour of the Scheme hold 99.9998% of the shareholding. The Scheme was, therefore, approved with
an overwhelming majority by the equity shareholders. Fifteen members holding 1657 shares i.e. .0002% have voted against the
Scheme. 587 votes representing 2118 equity shares were declared invalid. Similarly, an overwhelmingly large majority of secured
creditors and unsecured creditors accepted the Scheme at their respective meetings held on 21st October 2005. The Chairman’s
Reports indicate that Objectors to the Scheme were given an opportunity to express their views at the meetings;
4. After filing the present petition, notice of hearing of the Petition under Section 394A of the Companies Act, 1956 was advertised in two
local newspapers. Objections have been received from Bharat Gunvantrai Mankad and Kalpesh Bharatkumar Mankad (hereinafter
for the sake of brevity referred to as “the Mankads”) who have raised objections at the meeting convened for shareholders. Objections
have also been filed by Ghanshyam R. Mehta and Bhavesh R. Mehta (hereinafter for the sake of brevity referred to as “the Mehtas”)
to the Scheme of Arrangement.
5. The Mehtas have claimed that their interests would be vitally affected in the Suit filed by them against Reliance Telecom Ltd. for
the recovery of Rs.50,00,00,000/- (Rupees fifty Crores) before the Court of Civil Judge, Senior Division, Rajkot being Special Civil
Suit No.34 of 2001. They are not the shareholders of Reliance Industries Limited-the Petitioner Company nor are they creditors of
Reliance Industries Limited. Reliance Telecom Limited is an independent Company and not a subsidiary of the Petitioner Company.
In my view, the objections raised by the Mehtas need not be considered at all since they are neither shareholders nor creditors of
the Petitioner Company.
6. Many objections have been raised by the Mankads in their joint affidavit in reply to the Petition. However, when the petition was
heard, Mr. Unwalla appearing for them confined the objections to the following:
(i) Discrepancies in the Scheme of Arrangement circulated to the members and the one annexed to the present Petition.
(ii) Non-disclosure of material particulars regarding the assets of the Petitioner Company and disclosures which are made in
the Scheme are vague.
(iii) The latest financial position has not been disclosed to the Court which is a requirement of law.
7. The Apex Court in the case of Miheer H. Mafatlal vs. Mafatlal Industries Ltd., AIR 1997 SC 506, dealt with the fairness of a Scheme
of Amalgamation passed by a majority of the shareholders. One of the shareholders who was also a Director of the transferor
Company had raised several objections to the Scheme. While considering the provisions of Sections, 391, 392 and 393, the Apex
Court observed thus in paragraphs 28 and 28A:
“...On a conjoint reading of the relevant provisions of Sections 391 and 393 it becomes at once clear that the Company Court which
is called upon to sanction such a scheme has not merely to go by the ipse dixit of the majority of the shareholders or creditors or their
respective classes who might have voted in favour of the scheme by requisite majority but the Court has to consider the pros and
cons of the scheme with a view to finding out whether the scheme is fair, just and reasonable and is not contrary to any provisions
of law and it does not violate any public policy. This is implicit in the very concept of compromise or arrangement which is required
to receive the imprimatur of a Court of law. No Court of law would ever countenance any scheme of compromise or arrangement
arrived at between the parties and which might be supported by the requisite majority if the Court finds that it is an unconscionable
or an illegal scheme or is otherwise unfair or unjust to the class of shareholders or creditors for whom it is meant. Consequently it
cannot be said that a Company Court before whom an application is moved for sanctioning such a scheme which might have got
the requisite majority support of the creditors or members or any class of them for whom the scheme is mooted by the concerned
company, has to act merely as a rubber stamp and must almost automatically put its seal of approval on such a scheme. It is trite
to say that once the scheme gets sanctioned by the Court it would bind even the dissenting minority shareholders or creditors.
Therefore, the fairness of the scheme qua them also has to be kept in view by the Company Court while putting its seal of approval
on the concerned scheme placed for its sanction. It is, of course, true that so far as the Company Court is concerned as per the
statutory provisions of Sections 391 and 393 of the Act the question of voidability of the scheme will have to be judged subject to
the rider that a scheme sanctioned by a majority will remain binding to a dissenting minority of creditors or members, as the case
may be, even though they have not consented to such a scheme and to that extent absence of their consent will have no effect
on the scheme. It can be postulated that even in case of such a Scheme of Compromise and Arrangement put up for sanction of
a Company Court it will have to be seen whether the proposed scheme is lawful and just and fair to the whole class of creditors or
members including the dissenting minority to whom it is offered for approval and which has been approved by such class of persons
with requisite majority vote.”
“28-A. However further question remains whether the Court has jurisdiction like an appellate authority to minutely scrutinize the
scheme and to arrive at an independent conclusion whether the scheme should be permitted to go through or not when the majority
of the creditors or members or their respective classes have approved the scheme as required by Section 391 sub-section (2). On
this aspect the nature of compromise or arrangement between the company and the creditors and members has to be kept in view.
It is the commercial wisdom of the parties to the scheme who have taken an informed decision about the usefulness and propriety of
91
the scheme by supporting it by the requisite majority vote that has to be kept in view by the Court. The Court certainly would not act
as a Court of appeal and sit in judgement over the informed view of the concerned parties to the compromise as the same would be
in the realm of corporate and commercial wisdom of the concerned parties. The Court has neither the expertise nor the jurisdiction
to delve deep into the commercial wisdom exercised by the creditors and members of the company who have ratified the Scheme by
the requisite majority. Consequently the Company Court’s jurisdiction to that extent is peripheral and supervisory and not appellate.
The Court acts like an umpire in a game of cricket who has to see that both the teams play their game according to the rules and do
not overstep the limits. But subject to that how best the game is to be played is left to the players and not the umpire. The supervisor
jurisdiction of the Company Court can also be culled out from the provisions of Section 392 of the Act which reads as under:
“392. (1) Where a High Court makes an order under Section 391 sanctioning a compromise or an arrangement in respect of a
company if—
(a) shall have power to supervise the carrying out of the compromise or arrangement; and
(b) may, at the time of making such order or at any time thereafter, give such directions in regard to any matter or make such
modifications in the compromise or arrangement as it may consider necessary for the proper working of the compromise or
arrangement.
(2) If the Court aforesaid is satisfied that a compromise or arrangement sanctioned under Section 391 cannot be worked
satisfactorily with or without modifications, it may, either on its own motion or on the application of any person interested in
the affairs of the company, make an order winding up the company, and such an order shall be deemed to be an order made
under section 433 of this Act.
(3) The provisions of this section shall, so far as may be, also apply to a company in respect of which an order has been made
before the commencement of this Act under section 153 of the Indian Companies Act, 1913 (7 of 1913), sanctioning a
compromise or an arrangement”.
Of course this Section deals with post-sanction supervision. But the said provision itself clearly earmarks the field in which the
sanction of the Court operates. It is obvious that the supervisor cannot ever be treated as the author or a policy maker. Consequently
the propriety and the merits of the compromise or arrangement have to be judged by the parties who as sui juris with their open eyes
and fully informed about the pros and cons of the Scheme arrive at their own reasoned judgment and agree to be bound by such
compromise or arrangement. The Court cannot, therefore, undertake the exercise of scrutinizing the scheme placed for its sanction
with a view to finding out whether a better scheme could have been adopted by the parties. This exercise remains only for the parties
and is in the realm of commercial democracy permeating the activities of the concerned creditors and members of the company who
in their best commercial and economic interest by majority agree to give green signal to such a compromise or arrangement. The
aforesaid statutory scheme which is clearly discernible from the relevant provisions of the Act, as seen above, has been subjected
to a series of decisions of the different High Courts and this Court as well as by the Courts in England which had also occasion to
consider Schemes under pari materia English Company Law.”
8. The Apex court has then succintly outlined the broad framework within which the Company Court should function while
sanctioning a Scheme under the aforesaid Sections. These are as follows:
(1) The sanctioning Court has to see to it that all the requisite statutory procedure for supporting such a scheme has been
complied with and that the requisite meetings as contemplated by Section 391(1) have been held.
(2) That the scheme put up for sanction of the Court is backed up by the requisite majority vote as required by Section 391, subsection (2).
(3) That the concerned meetings of the creditors or members or any class of them had the relevant material to enable the voters
to arrive at an informed decision for approving the scheme in question. That the majority decision of the concerned class of
voters is just and fair to the class as a whole so as to legitimately bind even the dissenting members of that class.
(4) That all necessary material indicated by Section 393(1)(a) is placed before the voters at the concerned meetings as
contemplated by Section 391, sub-section (1).
(5) That all the requisite material contemplated by the proviso to sub-section (2) of Section 391 of the Act is placed before the
Court by the concerned applicant seeking sanction for such a scheme and the Court gets satisfied about the same.
(6) That the proposed scheme of compromise and arrangement is not found to be violative of any provision of law and is not
contrary to public policy. For ascertaining the real purpose underlying the Scheme with a view to be satisfied on this aspect,
the Court, if necessary, can pierce the veil of apparent corporate purpose underlying the scheme and can judiciously X-ray
the same.
(7) That the Company Court has also to satisfy itself that members or class of members or creditors or class of creditors, as the
case may be, were acting bona fide and in good faith and were not coercing the minority in order to promote any interest
adverse to that of the latter comprising of the same class whom they purported to represent.
(8) That the scheme as a whole is also found to be just, fair and reasonable from the point of view of prudent men of business
taking a commercial decision beneficial to the class represented by them for whom the scheme is meant.
(9) Once the aforesaid broad parameters about the requirement of a scheme for getting sanction of the Court are found to have
been met, the Court will have no further jurisdiction to sit in appeal over the commercial wisdom of the majority of the class
of persons who with their open eyes have given their approval to the scheme even if in the view of the Court there would be
a better scheme for the company and its members or creditors for whom the scheme is framed. The Court cannot refuse to
sanction such a scheme on that ground as it would otherwise amount to the Court exercising appellate jurisdiction over the
scheme rather than its supervisory jurisdiction.
However, the Court has cautioned that the aforesaid parameters are not exhaustive but broadly illustrative of the contours of
the Company Court’s jurisdiction.
92
9. A perusal of this judgement indicates that the role of a Company Court in sanctioning a Scheme of Arrangement is only supervisory.
The Company Court does not exercise appellate jurisdiction in such matters. Therefore, while considering the objections raised to
the Scheme, it would be appropriate to bear in mind the contours or parameters set by the Apex Court in the case of Mafatlal (supra).
10. As regards the first objection in respect of the discrepancy between the Scheme annexed to the Petition and the Scheme furnished
to the shareholders, the learned Counsel for the Petitioner Company admits that there are certain omissions in the Scheme annexed
to the Petition. However, he prays that the Petitioner Company be permitted to amend the Petition in order to insert the missing
statements. He further submits that the omissions in the Scheme annexed to the Petition are not fatal to the Petition.
11. It is obvious that certain statements made in the Schedules to the Scheme have been omitted in the Scheme of Arrangement
annexed at Exhibit “K” to the Petition. For instance Part “A” of Schedule I of the Scheme issued to the shareholders, contains a
statement “And such other properties as may be agreed between the Demerged Company and the Coal Based Energy Resulting
Company.” This statement does not find place in Schedule I to the Scheme found at Exhibit “K” to the Petition. Similarly, in Schedule
II, there is an omission to complete the statement “Other Fixed Assets of the Gas Based Energy Undertaking” in Exhibit “K”. Further
discrepancies have arisen in Schedule III and Schedule IV. These omissions in my opinion are not fatal to the Petition. The Scheme
which was circulated to the shareholders and other groups did contain these statements. They have voted on the Scheme as
circulated. Apart from this, the Petitioner Company has tendered draft amendments which are allowed on 8th December 2005 and
accordingly amendments have been carried out.
12. The learned Counsel for the Objectors Mr. Unwalla then submitted that there is non- disclosure of material facts relating to the
assets, loans and advances. According to him, such facts which are disclosed, are vague. The learned Counsel fairly accepts
the book value of the assets mentioned in each of the Schedules. However, he submits that it was necessary for the Petitioner
Company to indicate the methodology adopted by it to arrive at these figures. He has also stated that although certain assets of the
new Companies have been mentioned in the Schedules, there is a vague statement made that other properties or assets agreed
to between the demerged Company i.e. the Petitioner Company and the resulting Companies would form assets of the resulting
Companies. A statement is made by Mr. Chagla, learned Counsel for the Petitioner Company, on instructions, that there has been
no transfer of assets after the appointed date i.e. 1st September 2005. All assets have been transferred before that date as stated
in the Schedule. There has been no addition in the assets which are transferred after 1st September 2005, according to the learned
Counsel. He urges that there is sufficient disclosure of the assets as well as liabilities. In my view, the objection is untenable as
all the material facts have been disclosed. Apart from this, there is no prejudice which would be caused to the Objectors. The
contention that the Petitioner Company and the resulting Companies would be able to swap assets in future to the prejudice of the
shareholders also is unsustainable. Once the Scheme is sanctioned by the Court, it would not be possible to transfer the assets and
liabilities except by following due process of law. All transfers which have taken place prior to the appointed date have been reflected
in the Schedules.
13. The third contention raised by the Objectors is that the latest financial position has not been disclosed since the unaudited segment
information to the quarter/half year ended 30th September, 2005 has not been disclosed in the Petition. The learned Counsel for
the Petitioner Company submits that the requirement of law is that the unaudited accounts are to be simultaneously submitted
to Securities Exchange Board of India (SEBI), the Stock Exchange and released to the newspaper publications. The Petition
was filed on 24th October, 2005, whereas the unaudited accounts were published on 27th October, 2005 and, therefore, it was
not possible to include the unaudited accounts for the quarter year ended 30th September, 2005 in the Petition. In my view,
the objection raised is unsustainable. The proviso to Section 391(2) of the Companies Act, 1956 does stipulate that the latest
financial position is to be disclosed to the Court while proposing a Scheme of Arrangement. However, at the same time it is
necessary for the Company to observe the rigours of other provisions of law, which necessitate the submission of the unaudited
accounts simultaneously to the different authorities including SEBI and the Stock Exchange while publishing the information at the
same time in the newspapers. This was done on 27th October 2005. Since, there is an embargo on the prior disclosure of unaudited
accounts, it is obvious that the Company Petition filed on 24th October 2005 could not contain such information. Therefore, the
submission of the learned Counsel for the Objectors on this count is unsustainable.
14. Several other Objections have been raised by the Mankads in their affidavit filed on 28th November 2005; one of the main objections
being that the Scheme was a family arrangement arrived at, to the prejudice of the shareholders. However, it is unnecessary for me
to deal with those objections as the Objectors confined themselves to the aforesaid three-fold contentions.
15. Having considered the Scheme, as rightly pointed out by Mr. Dwarkadas, learned Counsel for the transferee Company i.e. Global
Fuel Management Services Limited, which is the resulting Company in respect of the Gas Based Energy Undertaking of the
Petitioner Company, the shareholders would not only hold shares in the parent Company i.e. the Petitioner Company but also in
each of the resulting Companies in the ratio of 1:1. The Scheme of Arrangement is fair and gives an opportunity to the shareholders
to decide whether they wish to continue to be shareholders of one or more of the resulting Companies or of the parent Company
alone.
16. In my view, keeping in mind the contours of the jurisdiction available to the Company Court while deciding a Petition under Section
391, the Scheme of Arrangement would have to be sanctioned. The objections raised are untenable. 99.81% of the shareholders
have in their commercial wisdom accepted the Scheme. It is not for the Company Court to decide whether a better Scheme could
have been proposed by the Company. The objectors have been unable to indicate as to how the Scheme is unfair or how they would
be prejudiced by the Scheme of Arrangement. In my view, as a whole, the Scheme of Arrangement is fair and reasonable from the
point of view of the commercial decision taken by an overwhelming majority of the shareholders. The Scheme cannot be said to be
against public policy. In fact, the Mankads are not really objecting to the Scheme but are insisting that there should be further and
better disclosure of the material particulars. In my view, all the necessary particulars have been disclosed by the Petitioner Company
in the Scheme of Arrangement and, therefore, the objections are without merit and are rejected.
17. The representative for the Regional Director of Companies states that the Petitioner Company and the resulting Companies would
have to comply with certain provisions of law which the Petitioner Company has undertaken to do. The Regional Director has no
objection to the Scheme of Arrangement being sanctioned.
18. Hence, the Company Petition is made absolute in terms of prayer clauses (a) to (h) subject to payment of costs to Regional Director
of Rs. 2,500/- (Rupees Two Thousand Five Hundred only).
93
19. All concerned parties including the concerned Registrar of Companies to act on the ordinary copy of the Order and Scheme annexed
to the Petition, authenticated by the Company Registrar, High Court, Bombay.
20. Filing of drawn up order is dispensed with.
21. Mr. More for the Objectors-Mankads seeks a stay of this order for six weeks. Mr. Chagla, learned counsel appearing for the
Petitioner Company, opposes.
22. In my view, there is no need to grant stay since the Objectors had candidly accepted the Scheme of Arrangement. Stay refused.
Prayer clauses (a) to (h) referred to in para 18 above are given below:
(a) that the arrangement emodied in the Scheme of Arrangement (Exhibit K hereto) be sanctioned by this Hon’ble Court so as to be
binding with effect from 1st September 2005, the Appointed Date on the Petitioner Company, its equity shareholoders, secured
creditors (including debenture holders) and unsecured creditors as also on the Resulting Companies and its equity shareholders,
creditors and all concerned persons;
(b) for an order under Section 394 of the Companies Act, 1956 for transfer and vesting of the Petitioner Company’s interest and
strategic investments in Coal based power business - Coal Based Energy Undertaking, Gas based power business - the Gas Based
Energy Undertaking, Financial servises business - the Financial Services Undertaking, and telecommunication business which
comprises the Telecommunication Undertaking, as set out in the Scheme being Exhibit “K” hereto shall without further act or deed
be transferred to and be vested in and/or deeemed to be transferred to and be vested in the respective Resulting Company.

(e) for an order that with effect from the Appointed Date, the properties and the debts, liabilities, duties and obligations, if any, relating
to the Demerged Undertakings (as defined in the Scheme) being transferred by the Petitioner Company are transferred to the
respective Resulting Company at the values appearing in the books of account of the Petitioner Company immediately before the
demerger;
(f) for an order that the respective Resulting Company issues shares to the eligible shareholders of the Petitioner Company (except

PREAMBLE
A. Description of Companies:
(a) The Reliance group, which comprises the Demerged Company (Transferor Company), viz. Reliance Industries Limited (“RIL”) its
subsidiaries and other affiliate companies is one of the largest business groups in India, and RIL, the flagship company of the group,
is one of India’s largest private sector industrial enterprises. Over the years, RIL embarked on a process of vertical integration and
at the same time ventured into new areas of business.
(b) RIL was originally engaged in trading of yarn and subsequently, expanded into manufacturing and trading of textiles at its unit
at Naroda, District Ahmedabad in the State of Gujarat. RIL ranks amongst the world’s top 10 producers for almost all its major
products. RIL’s strategy has been to build leading market shares in the domestic market, pursue selective export opportunities,
implement vertical integration, access leading technologies, achieve economies of scale, focus on financial management and
invest in infrastructure projects. RIL has undertaken expansion, diversification and restructuring of its business by various routes
including promoting new companies, investing in equity of companies, supplying equipment and manpower and acquiring rights and
assuming liabilities in new ventures in order to ensure greater shareholder value.
(c) To achieve its aforesaid objectives of vertical integration, expansion and diversification, RIL set up plants at Patalganga for
manufacture of polyester, fibre intermediates, and petrochemicals, followed by plants at Hazira for manufacture of petrochemicals
through Reliance Petrochemicals Limited (“RPCL”) and for manufacture of polymers through Reliance Polyethylene Limited
(“RPEL”) and Reliance Polypropylene Limited (“RPPL”). RIL also set up one of the largest greenfield refineries at Jamnagar in
the State of Gujarat through Reliance Petroleum Limited (“RPL”) for manufacture of petroleum products. With a view to enhance
shareholder value RPCL, RPPL, RPEL and RPL were amalgamated with RIL in stages to make RIL a vibrant and economically
strong corporate entity.
(d) The growth of RIL enabled RIL to consider further backward integration and RIL successfully bid for offshore oil and gas fields and
is engaged in oil and gas exploration and production at its oil and gas fields. RIL has been successful in locating gas fields capable
of commercial exploration and is in the process of developing the same with a view to commencing the production and sale of gas.
(e) RIL’s operations capture value addition at every stage, from the production of crude oil and gas to polyester, polymers and chemical
products, and finally to the production of textiles. RIL consolidated its strengths in the petrochemicals business by acquiring, through
Reliance Petroinvestments Limited, from Government of India, a substantial stake in Indian Petrochemicals Corporation Limited
(“IPCL”).
(f) In order to maximize shareholder value, RIL decided to expand into financial services business and into the business of
telecommunications as also to participate in the ongoing process of consolidation in the energy sector in the country, as follows:
(i) RIL’s business vision clearly included its foray into the power sector, which is an important constituent of the energy
sector and has tremendous synergy with the hydrocarbon sector in which RIL is one of the leading players. RIL acquired
considerable experience in the energy sector by setting up captive power projects for all its manufacturing and production
plants. RIL commenced its external foray in the power sector by planning to set up power plants in Jamnagar, Gujarat
(Reliance Power), Orissa (Hirma Power) and Tamil Nadu (Jayamkondam Power). RIL appointed a dedicated team
of executives drawn in house and from the power industry for undertaking the work of development of these projects.
In pursuance of its foray in the power sector, RIL decided to make a strategic investment in Reliance Energy Limited
(“REL”) (formerly BSES Limited), which is engaged in the generation of coal based power at Dahanu, Maharashtra and
also in the business of transmission and distribution of power to consumers in Mumbai, Delhi, Orissa, Goa, etc. In view of
the established power generation capacity and network of transmissions and distribution lines of REL, RIL decided that
the investment in REL would be more prudent in a business sense, than the setting up of a greenfield project by itself,
95
and accordingly, RIL acquired an equity shareholding and management control of REL. The strategic investment in the
equity shares of REL was made by RIL directly as well as through its wholly owned subsidiary, Reliance Power Ventures
Limited (“RPVL”). RIL made two open offers to acquire further shares of REL under the SEBI (Substantial Acquisition
of Shares and Takeovers) Regulations, 1997. The first open offer was made in May, 2000 and the second open offer
was made in December, 2002. RIL ultimately acquired management control of REL after the second open offer was
concluded in March, 2003. RIL is the single largest shareholder of REL. After acquiring the business of REL, RIL consolidated
its power business in REL by bringing its future power projects under REL’s fold and also assigning its dedicated team of
executives working on power projects to REL. RIL has powers to nominate or appoint majority directors on the Board of REL
as per Articles of Association of REL. The management and employees of RIL have been actively involved in overseeing and
monitoring the various aspects of the business of REL. The name of the company (viz. REL) which was undertaking the energy
business was altered from BSES Limited to Reliance Energy Limited i.e. REL and the “Reliance” name and logo as well as the
brand equity of “Reliance” has been used to support and promote the said power business. The abovementioned businesses
as an integrated whole (other than captive power projects for RIL’s manufacturing plants), constitute the Coal Based Energy
Undertaking of RIL.
(ii) RIL’s foray into the power business got a great boost with the discovery of gas in its exploration blocks on the eastern coast of
India. This facilitated RIL to expand its activities in the gas based energy business where gas could be used as a primary fuel.
This allows integration of the gas to power value chain and enables exploiting of the synergies therein. Consequently, REL
has announced setting up of gas based power generation projects in India. RIL proposes to use part of its gas discoveries
for the generation of power for which purpose an appropriate gas supply arrangement will be entered into between RIL and
Global Fuel Management Services Limited, pursuant to which gas will be supplied to REL for their power projects, including
Reliance Patalganga Power Limited, for the generation of power. The above mentioned business of supply of gas to REL for
their power projects including Reliance Patalganga Power Limited, for generation of power as an integrated whole, constitute
the Gas Based Energy Undertaking of RIL.
(iii) RIL made its foray into the financial services business by promoting and setting up a new company, namely, Reliance
Capital Limited (formerly known as Reliance Capital and Finance Trust Limited) (hereinafter referred to as “RCL”) to carry
on business activities in traditional finance areas of leasing, merchant banking, etc. RIL expanded its financial business
into stock broking and trading by causing RCL to set up a subsidiary (known as Reliance Share and Stock Brokers Private
Limited) to carry on the business of stock broking and trading in 1994. During the financial year 1995-96, RIL made a
foray into the mutual fund business through RCL by sponsoring a mutual fund (viz. Reliance Mutual Fund) and by setting
up an asset management company and trustee company for the purposes of carrying on mutual fund activities. As a part
of its foray in the financial services business, RIL set up Reliance Life Insurance Company Limited (“Reliance Life”) and
Reliance General Insurance Company Limited (“Reliance General”) for undertaking life and general insurance business
respectively. At the time of promotion, RIL had provided various assurances and undertakings to concerned authorities
based on which licenses have been issued. Subsequently, RIL transferred its shareholding to the extent of 75% in these
companies to RCL. While the business of Reliance General has made significant progress, the business in Reliance
Life has yet to start. The “Reliance” name and logo as well as the brand equity of “Reliance” were used to establish and
promote various financial products launched as part of the mutual fund business and the general insurance business.
Further, RIL provided the necessary infrastructure, support, expertise and experience available with it to ensure that the
financial services business progressed smoothly in the nascent stage. RIL provided the initial funds required for setting
up the aforesaid financial services business and the management of RIL was actively involved in the process of setting
up as well as overseeing and monitoring the various aspects of its financial services business. The respective businesses
were promoted in separate companies from the point of view of providing better visibility and maximizing shareholder value
as well as to provide autonomy in the day-to-day functioning of the businesses. The abovementioned businesses as an
integrated whole, constitute the Financial Services Undertaking of RIL.
(iv) RIL also ventured into the business of providing telecommunication services, once the Indian telecommunication sector
was opened up by the Government to private sector participation. The business of telecommunication services provided an
excellent business opportunity to RIL in view of the tremendous potential for growth of the business both domestically
as well as in overseas markets. RIL promoted Reliance Telecom Limited (“RTL”) for providing cellular mobile telephone
services using the GSM technology in East and North-East India and basic telephone services in the State of Gujarat. RIL
subsequently promoted Reliance Communications Infrastructure Limited (“RCIL”) for setting up the backbone infrastructure
required for its telecom operations and simultaneously also promoted and set up Reliance Infocomm Limited (“RIC”) for
providing wireless services based on CDMA technology, wireline telecommunication services and broadband services in
various parts of India. The “Reliance” name and logo as well as the brand equity of “Reliance” were used to establish
and promote various telecom services launched by RTL, RCIL and RIC. Further, RIL provided the necessary manpower,
infrastructure support, expertise and experience by assigning teams of employees to oversee the launch of its telecom
services by RTL, RCIL and RIC and ensure that its telecom business progressed smoothly in the nascent stage. The
support of RIL’s countrywide dealer network was solicited to effectively market the telecom services. All these projects
were supported by RIL initially by providing guarantees to DoT for obtaining licenses to provide such telecom services. The
management of RIL was actively involved in the process of setting up as well as overseeing and monitoring the various
aspects of the telecom services business. The various telecom services were promoted in separate companies from the
point of view of meeting regulatory requirements, providing better visibility and maximizing shareholder value as well as to
provide autonomy in the day-to-day functioning of the businesses. Apart from the above, RIL also provided several of its
assets to the telecom business. In January 2004, in order to further strengthen its international telecommunication business,
RIC acquired Bermuda based FLAG Telecom Group Limited which owns submarine cable systems in international waters.
The abovementioned businesses carried on by RIL through RTL, RCIL and RIC, as an integrated whole, constitute the
Telecommunication Undertaking of RIL.
(g) Based on the aforesaid, RIL’s several businesses carried on by itself and through its subsidiaries and affiliate companies and
through strategic investments in other companies can broadly be segregated into the following areas: (i) petrochemicals; (ii) refining;
(iii) oil and gas; (iv) textiles; (v) coal based power generation; (vi) gas based power generation (vii) financial services business
including insurance business; and (viii) telecommunications
96
B. Rationale for the Scheme of Arrangement:
(a) Each of the several businesses carried on by RIL by itself and through its subsidiaries and affiliate companies and through
strategic investments in other companies including Coal Based Energy Undertaking, Gas Based Energy Undertaking, Financial
Services Undertaking and Telecommunication Undertaking have significant potential for growth. The nature of risk and
competition involved in each of these businesses is distinct from others and consequently each business or undertaking is
capable of attracting a different set of investors, strategic partners, lenders and other stakeholders. There are also differences
in the manner in which each of these businesses are required to be managed.
In order to enable distinct focus of investors to invest in some of the key businesses and to lend greater focus to the operation of
each of its diverse businesses, RIL proposes to re-organize and segregate, by way of a demerger, its business and undertakings
engaged in:
(i) Coal based power generation, distribution and transmission - Coal Based Energy Undertaking.
(ii) Gas based power generation, distribution and transmission - Gas Based Energy Undertaking
(iii) Financial services including insurance - Financial Services Undertaking.
(iv) Wireless & Wireline telecommunication services- Telecommunication Undertaking.
(b) Each of these businesses have tremendous growth and profitability potential and are at a stage where they require focused leadership
and management attention. Hence, simultaneously, with the re-organisation and segregation of businesses, RIL also intends to
re-organise the management of various businesses and undertakings to provide focused management attention and leadership
required by the businesses which are to be segregated and demerged. In particular, Shri Anil D. Ambani, the erstwhile Vice
Chairman & Managing Director of RIL would take responsibility for providing such focused management attention and leadership to
the segregated and demerged businesses whereas Shri Mukesh D. Ambani, Chairman & Managing Director of RIL would continue
to lead the businesses retained by RIL including, in particular petrochemicals, refining, oil and gas exploration and production,
textiles and other businesses.
(c) It is believed that the proposed segregation will create enhanced value for shareholders and allow a focused strategy in operations,
which would be in the best interest of RIL, its shareholders, creditors and all persons connected with RIL. The demerger proposed
by this Scheme of Arrangement will enable investors to separately hold investments in businesses with different investment
characteristics thereby enabling them to select investments which best suit their investment strategies and risk profiles.
(d) The demerger will also provide scope for independent collaboration and expansion without committing the existing organization in
its entirety.
(e) With the aforesaid objective, it is proposed to demerge RIL’s undertakings comprising RIL’s interests and strategic investments
in (i) coal based power business; (ii) gas based power business; (iii) financial services business including insurance, and (iv)
telecommunications business from RIL’s interests in the multi-location, vertically integrated, businesses in petrochemicals, refining,
oil and gas and textiles and other businesses.
(f) The Board of Directors of the Demerged Company are of the opinion that the demerger would benefit the shareholders, employees
and other stakeholders of the Demerged Company.
C. Purpose of the Scheme:
(a) It is therefore proposed that each of RIL’s undertakings comprising RIL’s interests and strategic investments in (i) coal based power
business; (ii) gas based power business; (iii) financial services business; and (iv) telecommunication business be segregated and
demerged, pursuant to a Scheme of Arrangement under Sections 391 to 394 of the Companies Act, 1956 and transferred to separate
companies for achieving independent focus in these areas. RIL will continue its interests in the businesses of petrochemicals,
refining, oil and gas exploration & production and textiles and develop new areas in the economic development of the country.
(b) With the aforesaid objective, each of the Resulting Companies is intended to give effect to the terms of this Scheme of Arrangement.
The Coal Based Energy Resulting Company (1st Transferee Company) has been incorporated with one of its main objects as:
“To carry on, manage, supervise and control the business of transmitting, manufacturing, supplying, generating, distributing and
dealing in electricity and all forms of energy and power generated by any source whether nuclear, steam, hydro or tidal, water, wind,
solar, hydrocarbon fuel or any other form, kind or description”;
the Gas Based Energy Resulting Company (2nd Transferee Company) has been incorporated with one of its main objects as:
“To carry on, manage, supervise and control the business of transmitting, manufacturing, supplying, generating, distributing and
dealing in electricity and all forms of energy and power generated by any source whether nuclear, steam, hydro or tidal, water, wind,
solar, hydrocarbon fuel, natural gas or any other form, kind or description”;
the Financial Services Resulting Company (3rd Transferee Company) has been incorporated with one of its main objects as:
“To carry on and undertake the business of finance, investment, loan and guarantee company and to invest in, acquire, subscribe,
purchase, hold, sell, divest or otherwise deal in securities, shares, stocks, equity linked securities, debentures, debenture stock,
bonds, commercial papers, acknowledgements, deposits, notes, obligations, futures, calls, derivatives, currencies and securities of
any kind whatsoever, whether issued or guaranteed by any person, company, firm, body, trust, entity, government, state, dominion
sovereign, ruler, commissioner, public body or authority, supreme, municipal, local or otherwise, whether in India or abroad and
subject to such permissions and licenses as may be necessary, carry on, manage, supervise and control business of insurance
(including general insurance and life insurance). The Company will not carry on any activity as per Section 45 IA of RBI Act, 1934”;
and the Telecommunication Resulting Company (4th Transferee Company) has been incorporated with one of its main objects as:
“To carry on, manage, supervise and control the business of telecommunication, infrastructure, telecommunication system,
telecommunication network and telecommunication services of all kinds including and not limited to setting up telephone exchange,
coaxial stations, telecommunication lines and cables of every form and description, transmission, emission, reception through
various forms, maintaining and operating all types of telecommunication service and providing data programmes and data bases for
telecommunication”.
(c) In furtherance of the aforesaid, this Scheme of Arrangement provides for:
(i) the demerger of the Coal Based Energy Undertaking (as defined hereinafter) from RIL to the Coal Based Energy Resulting
Company;
(ii) the demerger of the Gas Based Energy Undertaking (as defined hereinafter) from RIL to the Gas Based Energy Resulting
Company;
97
(iii) the demerger of the Financial Services Undertaking (as defined hereinafter) from RIL to the Financial Services Resulting
Company;
(iv) the demerger of the Telecommunication Undertaking (as defined hereinafter) from RIL to the Telecommunication Resulting
Company;
(v) various other matters consequential or otherwise integrally connected herewith, including the reorganization of the capital of
RIL and the Resulting Companies;
(d) The demerger of the Coal Based Energy Undertaking, Gas Based Energy Undertaking, Financial Services Undertaking and
Telecommunication Undertaking of RIL under this Scheme of Arrangement will be effected under the provisions of Sections 391 to
394 of the Companies Act, 1956. The demerger complies with the provisions of Section 2(19AA) of the Income Tax Act, 1961, such
that:
(i) All the properties of the Demerged Undertakings (as defined hereinafter) being transferred by RIL immediately before the
demerger become the properties of the respective Resulting Companies by virtue of the demerger;
(ii) All the liabilities relatable to the Demerged Undertakings being transferred by RIL, immediately before the demerger become
the liabilities of the respective Resulting Companies by virtue of the demerger;
(iii) The properties and the liabilities, if any, relatable to the Demerged Undertakings being transferred by RIL are transferred
to the respective Resulting Companies at the values appearing in the books of account of RIL immediately before the
demerger;
(iv) Each of the Resulting Companies issue shares to the shareholders of RIL (except certain Specified Shareholders, as defined
hereinafter) in consideration of the demerger on a proportionate basis;
(v) All shareholders of RIL (except certain Specified Shareholders, as defined hereinafter) shall become the shareholders of
each of the Resulting Companies by virtue of the demerger; and
(vi) The transfer of the Demerged Undertakings will be on a going concern basis.
(e) Both RIL and its wholly owned subsidiary, Reliance Industrial Investments and Holdings Limited (“RIIHL”) had held shares in the
erstwhile RPL. Upon the amalgamation of RPL with RIL, the shares of RIL to be issued against the shares held by RIIHL in RPL were
allotted to the Trustees of the Petroleum Trust (a private trust, whose sole beneficiary is RIIHL, which is a wholly owned subsidiary
of RIL) and they hold approximately 7.5% of the paid up capital of RIL. Likewise Reliance Polyolefins Private Limited, Reliance
Aromatics and Petrochemicals Private Limited, Reliance Energy and Project Development Private Limited, and Reliance Chemicals
Private Limited were issued shares of RIL against their shareholding in RPL which was funded by RIL for the economic benefit of
the shareholders of RIL and they hold approximately 4.7% of the paid up capital of RIL. The Trustees of the Petroleum Trust and
the aforesaid four companies (viz. Reliance Polyolefins Private Limited, Reliance Aromatics and Petrochemicals Private Limited,
Reliance Energy and Project Development Private Limited, and Reliance Chemicals Private Limited) are collectively defined as the
“Specified Shareholders” in this Scheme. The economic benefits of shares of RIL held by Petroleum Trust and by the aforesaid four
companies have been for the benefit of RIL’s shareholders. The intent of the said Trustees and the Board of Directors of the said
four Companies is to enable RIL’s shareholders to directly benefit from the shares of RIL held by the said Specified Shareholders. In
furtherance of such intent and in order to ensure that the demerger of the aforesaid four undertakings of RIL is effectively achieved,
the Specified Shareholders have communicated to RIL that no shares of the Resulting Companies be issued to them. Consequently,
the Scheme of Arrangement provides that the shares of the Resulting Companies would not be issued to the Specified Shareholders.
Though no additional shares of the Resulting Companies would be required to be issued to the shareholders of RIL as a result of
the decision by the Specified Shareholders not to take up their entitlement, the proportionate value of the Shares of each Resulting
Company issued and allotted to each shareholder of RIL (other than the Specified Shareholders) would have an enhanced value.

Resulting Companies and thereby effectively achieve separation of the Demerged Company ’s interests in the aforesaid
businesses, each of the Resulting Companies will issue equity shares only to the shareholders of the Demerged Company

Company) is for the benefit of the shareholders of the Demerged Company. The said four companies have decided
that they will not take up their proportionate entitlement to shares in each Resulting Company for benefit of the other
shareholders of the Demerged Company. In keeping with the foregoing benefit, each of the Resulting Companies
will issue equity shares only to the shareholders of the Demerged Company (other than the Specified Shareholders),
consequently, enhancing the value of the new equity shares issued to the shareholders of the Demerged Company (other
than the Specified Shareholders) in view of Reliance Polyolefins Private Limited, Reliance Aromatics and Petrochemicals
Private Limited, Reliance Energy and Project Development Private Limited and Reliance Chemicals Private Limited having

IPCL encompasses commodity plastic raw materials namely Polypropylene (PP), Polyethylene (PE) and Poly Vinyl Chloride

Allahabad (Uttar Pradesh), Hoshiarpur (Punjab), Barabanki (Uttar Pradesh), Dhenkanal (Orissa), Nagpur (Maharashtra) and
Silvassa (Union Territory of Daman & Diu).
II. Reliance Industries Limited (“RIL” or the “Transferee Company”), is a company incorporated under the Companies Act,
1956 having its Registered Office at 3rd Floor, Maker Chambers IV, 222, Nariman Point, Mumbai- 400 021. The Transferee
Company is one of India’s largest private sector industrial enterprises in terms of net turnover, total assets, net worth and net
profit and is a Fortune 500 company. RIL ranks amongst the world’s top 10 producers for almost all its products. Over the years,
RIL’s strategy has been to build leading market share in the domestic market, pursue export opportunities, implement vertical,
forward and backward integration and, at the same time, to achieve economies of scale, focus on financial management and
invest in infrastructure projects.
III. This Scheme of Amalgamation provides for the amalgamation of the Transferor Company with the Transferee Company
pursuant to Sections 391 to 394 and other relevant provisions of the Act.
B. Rationale for the Scheme
The amalgamation of the Transferor Company with the Transferee Company would inter alia have the following benefits:
(a) Greater size, scale, integration and greater financial strength and flexibility for the amalgamated entity which would result in
maximising overall shareholder value;
(b) Strengthening leadership in the industry, not only in terms of the assets base, revenues, product range, production volumes
and market share, but also in terms of total shareholder return;
(c) The synergies that exist between the two entities in terms of the products, processes and resources can be put to the best
advantage of all stakeholders;
(d) The amalgamated entity will have the ability to leverage on its large asset base, diverse range of products and services, and
vast pool of intellectual capital, to enhance shareholder value;
(e) The amalgamation will result in increased financial strength and flexibility, and enhance the ability of the amalgamated entity
to undertake large projects, thereby contributing to enhancement of future business potential;
(f) The integration of the manufacturing and other facilities of IPCL and RIL will contribute to enhanced global competitiveness for
the amalgamated entity, thereby increasing its ability to compete with its peer group in domestic and international markets;
(g) The amalgamated entity will benefit from improved organizational capability and leadership, arising from the combination of
people from IPCL and RIL who have the diverse skills, talent and vast experience to compete successfully in an increasingly
competitive industry; and
(h) Cost savings are expected to flow from more focused operational efforts, rationalization, standardisation and simplification of
business processes, productivity improvements, improved procurement, and the elimination of duplication.
In view of the aforesaid, the Board of Directors of IPCL as well as the Board of Directors of RIL have considered and proposed
the amalgamation of the entire undertaking and business of IPCL with RIL in order to benefit the stakeholders of both companies.
Accordingly, the Board of Directors of both the companies have formulated this Scheme of Amalgamation for the transfer and vesting
of the entire undertaking and business of IPCL to RIL pursuant to the provisions of Section 391 to Section 394 of the Act.

RE: AMALGAMATION OF TRANSFEROR COMPANY WITH TRANSFEREE COMPANY:

of Directors of the Transferor Company passed a Resolution at its meeting held on 10.3.2007 approved the said Scheme
subject to obtaining of all requisite approvals, if any, of the appropriate authorities and subject to the approval of the High
Court of Judicature at Bombay and the High Court of Gujarat at Ahmedabad.
3.7 The Board of Directors of the Transferee Company (Reliance Industries Limited) has also passed a similar Resolution at
its meeting held on 10.3.2007.
3.8 Accordingly, the Scheme of Amalgamation was prepared. The rationale for the Scheme is stated as under:
“The amalgamation of the Transferor Company with the Transferee Company would, inter alia, have the following benefits:
(a) Greater size, scale, integration and greater financial strength and flexibility for the amalgamated entity, which would
result in maximising overall shareholder value;
(b) Strengthening leadership in the industry, not only in terms of the assets base, revenues, product range, production
volumes and market share, but also in terms of total shareholder return;
(c) The synergies that exist between the two entities in terms of the products, processes and resources can be put to
the best advantage of all stakeholders;
(d) The amalgamated entity will have the ability to leverage on its large asset base, diverse range of products and
services and vast pool of intellectual capital, to enhance shareholder value;
(e) The amalgamation will result in increased financial strength and flexibility, and enhance the ability of the
amalgamated entity to undertake large projects, thereby contributing to enhancement of future business potential;
(f) The integration of the manufacturing and other facilities of IPCL and RIL will contribute to enhanced global
competitiveness for the amalgamated entity, thereby increasing its ability to compete with its peer group in domestic
and international markets;
(g) The amalgamated entity will benefit from improved organizational capability and leadership, arising from the
combination of people from IPCL and RIL who have the diverse skills, talent and vast experience to compete
successfully in an increasingly competitive industry; and
(h) Cost savings are expected to flow from more focused operational efforts, rationalization, standardization and
simplification of business processes, productivity improvements, improved procurement and the elimination of
duplication.”
3.9 The Transferor Company had filed an application being Company Application No. 126 of 2007 before this Court. This Court

which is at page 114 and reported the above results. The Chairman has also filed an affidavit in support of the said report.

Company (RIL).

not against the public policy. The Official Liquidator has also filed his report stating that by sanctioning the Scheme, the
interest of members and public at large would not be prejudiced. In addition, even Bombay Stock Exchange Limited and
National Stock Exchange of India Limited have granted their no-objection to the Scheme as is required under Clause 24(f)
of the Listing Agreement. Thus, the fact that these independent bodies, after scrutinizing the Scheme, have granted their
no-objection, clearly shows that the Scheme is in compliance with statutory requirements and is NOT opposed to public
policy nor is against public interest.
5.3 As regards the Transferee Company, as the registered office of the Transferee Company is situated within the State
of Maharashtra, the Transferee Company has filed application before the Bombay High Court. Pursuant to the order of
the Bombay High Court dated 16.3.2007 in Company Application No. 283 of 2007 filed by the Transferee Company, the
Transferee Company had held separate meetings of Equity Shareholders, the Secured Creditors (including Debentureholders) and unsecured creditors of the Transferee Company on 21.4.2007. The Chairman of the said meetings has

before the Bombay High Court. It was stated that the Scheme is subject to sanction of both the High Courts.

proceedings initiated by the Transferee Company before the Bombay High Court, the Bombay High Court by its order dated
12.6.2007 has sanctioned the Scheme subject to the Scheme also being sanctioned by this Court (page No. 181 of the

to the scheme of amalgamation. The nature of objectors are under:
5.5A Objection-I has been raised by ancillary industries who have established when IPCL was incorporated in the then remote
village at Vadodara District as well as Raighad at Maharashtra.
5.5B SC/ST employees who were also employed earlier by IPCL in view of Article 16(4) of the Constitution of India have raised
their objection in regard to the amalgamation.
5.5C Three Trade Unions, namely, IPCL Employees’ Association, IPCL Employees’ Union, and Petrochemical Employees’
Union and other Trade Union of Employees of IPCL have objected to the scheme on the ground that before the scheme
was finalized, they were not consulted and heard. They were also not taken into confidence before the Scheme of
Amalgamation was initiated.
5.5D The workers and some employee-shareholders have also raised their objections, namely, the scheme of amalgamation is
against the public interest and public policy. The amalgamation scheme ought not to have been sanctioned because there
are hidden objects by the transferee Company.
5.5E The objectors have also raised contention that while sanctioning the scheme this Court must lift the corporate veil and look
to the realities of the matter.
5.5F The objectors have also objected to the share exchange ratio which has been determined by two Chartered Accountants
firms that the same is not fair and proper and therefore the scheme ought not to have been sanctioned. The objector has
also raised contention that the Companies have called combined meeting of secured creditors and debenture holders as
the interest of debenture holders and secured creditors is different, the Companies ought to have held different meeting
between them.
5.5G The objector has also objected that some of the proxies collected from the shareholders or employees are collected under
compulsion and coercion and therefore the result in the companies depends upon the shareholders voting is thus vitiated.
5.5H As far as ancillary industries are concerned, the objection has been raised by Mr. P.R. Thakkar who has been ably
supported by Mr. Shalin Mehta, learned advocate. As regards SC/ST employees the objection has been raised by Mr.
Ramnandan Singh before this Court. As regards workers are concerned, the objection has been raised by Mr. Girish Patel,
ld. sr. counsel with Mr. Shalin Mehta and other objections have been raised by Mr. Shalin Mehta, learned advocate.

6.4 The Ministry of Chemical and Fertilizer was managing and superintending the affairs of IPCL, who decided to have such
industries in backward and tribal area of the nation, so that people of that area can be offered employment and other
industrial benefits can be earned.
6.5 The IPCL at Nagothane, was required to give employment to the project affected person (Tribal one and others). Hence
decided to raise Ancillary Industries to be formed within 10 kms. radius. Hence tender notice dated 21/2/1992 inviting
application for establishing Ancillary Industry for IPCL (Annexure-A, page-20)
 Pre Conditions prescribed in Annexure-A
1. Entrepreneur should be financially sound and technically competent.

constituted committee selected to be registered as Ancillary Industries. Hence, the opponent IPCL issued the letter of intent
dated 9/10/1992 (Annexure-B, page-25). Thus, the contract was entered into between the applicant and the IPCL, thereby
as per clause 5 of (Annexure-A) tender notice and as per clause 2 of Annexure-B letter of intent, the IPCL is bound to give
the purchase orders to the Ancillary Industries at least to the extent of 50% of the total production of the Ancillary Industries.
The letter of intent the IPCL has clearly stated that they are declaring and registering the applicant company as Ancillary
Unit to IPCL.
6.7 The Ancillary Industry is defined in Section 3(aa) of the Industries (Development and Regulation) Act, 1951 as under:
“Ancillary industrial undertakings means an industrial undertaking, which in accordance with the proviso to sub-section (I)
of Section 11-B and the requirements specified under that sub-section, is entitled to be registered as an ancillary industrial
undertaking for the purpose of this Act.”
6.7A The “Industrial Undertaking” is defined under Section 3 (d) of the said Act, means any undertaking pertaining to a schedule
industry carried on in one or more factories by any person or authority including government. And Schedule Industry means
any of the industries specified in first Schedule of the said Act.
6.7B The proviso to Section 11(b) of the said Act provides that, “provided that no industrial undertaking said be regarded as
an Ancillary Industrial Undertaking unless it is, or is proposed to be engaged in, rendering of services of supplying or
rendering, not more than 50% of its production or its total services, as the case may be, to other units for the production of
other articles.”
6.7C It is submitted that it is amply clear that to be an Ancillary Industry of opponent IPCL, the IPCL is statutorily bound to
purchase the 50% of the production of the Ancillary Industry i.e. applicants.
6.8 The applicants, on the basis of the aforesaid agreement, were induced to invest more than Rs.60 lacs (by Rachana Polypack
and huge amount by Schon Plastic Pvt. Ltd.) within six months as per terms of Annexure-A and B and established the
Ancillary Industry to IPCL by installing the plant machinery industrial shed etc. It is also pertinent to note that a special valve
type bag which is highly technical and peculiar production was agreed to be produced as per the stringent specifications
given by IPCL, which is one of the mandatory term of the contract. Therefore, a special type of plant and machinery were
installed and the production of Ancillary Industry could not be usable to other customers as it was meet only standard for
IPCL.
6.9 The applicant Ancillary Industries and other about four industries have employed project affected people to the tune of
about more than 500 employees, which were otherwise the liability of IPCL. It is pertinent to note that by way of such
agreement the said liability was shifted over the Ancillary Industries and thereby the IPCL has eaten the fruits of the
contract, by conveying to the World Bank, that novel way of providing livelihood to the tribal people (project affected people)
135
by raising the Ancillary Industries to IPCL and thereby the establishment of industry causing the development of economy
of nation and thereby ultimately the World Bank had extended its aiding hands to IPCL.
6.10 In June, 2002, the Government of India as a part of disinvestment program, divested 26% of its shares in IPCL in favour of
Reliance Petro Investment Ltd. (RPIL). The associated of Reliance Industries Ltd. (RIL). Thereafter, RIL chosen to acquire other
20% shares from market. Shri Mukesh D. Ambani become Chairman of IPCL.
6.11 Thereafter IPCL started to commit breach and stopped to give the purchase orders to Ancillary Industries. Hence initially
approached to the Hon’ble Disinvestment Minister, while diverting initial 26% shares, where Shri Mukesh Ambani assured
to survive the Ancillary Industries of Nagothane. Still however breach committed.
6.12 Hence writ petition before the Bombay High Court at Annexure-D, order of Bombay High Court at Annexure-E that relief
claim can be prayed for either in civil court or by way of conciliation - mediation, arbitration. Thereafter, letter-Annexure-F
for resolving dispute by arbitration as suggested by Bombay High Court.
6.13 Rachana Polytech of Company Application No. 257 of 2007 has filed Special Civil Suit No.128 of 2007 (Annexure-J, page81) against IPCL for specific performance of contract (Annexure-A and B), wherein alternatively prayed for compensation
/ damages to the tune of Rs. 3,41,21,000/-. The prayer is made in para 26 of the plaint at running page 117.
6.14 The applicant respectfully submits that the IPCL has not at all disclosed anything regarding such contractual liability in
the proposed scheme of amalgamation. It is pertinent to note that so far as 500 project affected employees employed
by Ancillary Industries are concerned, nothing has been stated in the scheme of amalgamation sought to be sanctioned
by this Court. The opponent IPCL, virtually a commanding management of RIL, has chosen to commit the breach of the
contract and chosen to destroy the entire Ancillary Industries with an ulterior motive to assign such job of production to their
related persons. Thus, the transferee company would not honour the contract with Ancillary Industries in as much as they
collusively not all disclosed these facts in the proposed scheme of amalgamation. Not only that but they have not provided
any thing in the scheme itself except to have a general statement that legal proceeding against the IPCL would be construed
as proceeding against the transferee company. As per Section 394 of the Companies Act, the Court is empowered to make
the provision while dealing with the issue of sanction of amalgamation scheme pertaining to the transfer to transferee
company of the whole or any part of undertaking, property or liability of the transferor company and can also provide for
implementing the order of Bombay High Court in real spirit so as to resolve the dispute either by Arbitration method or
otherwise. Therefore, it is quite necessary in the interest of justice to impose the condition while sanctioning the scheme
that the any contractual liability of IPCL would be construed as if liability belongs to RIL i.e. transferee company and the
suits pending against the IPCL in Vadodara Civil Court as well in Raigadh Civil Court required to be construed as if pending
against the transferee company and transferee company is required to be directed to meet with the liability in future if any
arise by way of decree to be passed by the concerned courts.
6.15 Attention of this Court is invited to the affidavit in reply filed by IPCL at page 121 in Company Application No. 257 of 2007
wherein, in para 7, the opponent IPCL, has to some extent considered the position that the contract would be automatically
get transferred to RIL upon the scheme being sanctioned but the opponent IPCL has chosen to deny the existence of the
contract with Ancillary Industries. Such denial on affidavit is absolutely false one, in as much as the opponent IPCL has
admitted the existence of the contract on affidavit before the Raigadh Civil Court in a suit filed by Schon Plastic Pvt. Ltd.
the applicant of Company Application No. 255 of 2007. Copy of the order passed below Exh. 5 of Raigadh Civil Court is
produced while arguing this Company Application and pointed out by reading para 27 of the said order wherein the learned
Judge has found in the following manner.
“If written statement Exh. 21 is looked into, the defendant admit that on various terms and conditions stated in the letters
written by the defendant to the plaintiff, the plaintiff was registered as Ancillary Unit in the year, 1991. However, at no point
of time plaintiff was given status of permanent or perpetual unit.”
6.15A Thus, the IPCL have admitted the existence of the contract before the Raigahd Civil Court, while before this Court in
affidavit in reply in para 7, the IPCL chosen to deny the existence of the contract (page no.123, para-7).
6.16 The IPCL has not made any provision either to award retrenchment compensation to the Ancillary Industry for project
affected employees, employed by the Ancillary Industries to the tune of about 500 and there is absolute non disclosure of
the said in the scheme.
6.17 The learned advocate has invited the attention of this Court that applicant of Company Application No. 257 of 2007, the
Rachana Ploypack filed suit for specific performance of the contract and for compensation before the Vadodara Civil Court,
by applying Section 19 and 20 of Code of Civil Procedure. It is pertinent to note that the applicant has got statutory rights
under the said Section of CPC to file a suit against the defendant IPCL at the place, where the principle/registered office
of IPCL is situated namely at Vadodara or can file a suit at the place where cause of action has been arisen. In the instant
case the applicant has chosen to file a suit at Vadodara Civil Court, as the Principle/registered office of the IPCL is situated
at Vadodara and thereby by considering to explanation to Section-20 the suit is maintainable within the jurisdiction of Civil
Court at Vadodara. There are all possibilities that after amalgamation as the existence of the IPCL would be abolish and as
the principle office of the transferee company is situated at Bombay, the transferee company may take a contention before
the Civil Court, Vadodara that in view of Section 20 of CPC, the Bombay Court would have only the jurisdiction as the
registered office is now not situated at Vadodara. Thus, there are all likelihood to pluck away the statutory rights of applicant,
namely right to file a suit at a particular place namely at Vadodara against the IPCL, having its principle office at Vadodara.
Thus, the scheme of amalgamation, which take away the statutory right of any litigant, cannot be sanctioned or the Court
is empowered under the provisions to protect such statutory rights of the applicant.
6.18 Thus, considering the aforesaid submissions, it is submitted to this Court either to reject the scheme of amalgamation or be
kind enough to protect the Ancillary Industries from being destroyed by IPCL or RIL and be pleased to make a provision for
protecting the contractual interest of the Ancillary Industry and/or the litigation pending between the Ancillary Industry and
IPCL and be pleased to provide for protection of 500 project affected employees, employed by Ancillary Industry, which
were and are otherwise the liability of IPCL and be pleased to further protect the jurisdiction of Vadodara Civil Court by
holding that, if otherwise the Vadodara Civil Court has jurisdiction then the transferee company cannot raise the contention
of jurisdiction on the ground that the principle office of RIL i.e. transferee company is at Bombay and not at Vadodara.
136
OBJECTION ON BEHALF OF SC/ST EMPLOYEES - BY SHRI RAMNANDAN SINGH, LD. ADVOCATE:
7. Mr. Ramnandan Singh, learned advocate, submitted that there are about five members who belonged to SC/ST category who were
working in IPCL who have made representation on behalf of all SC/ST employees. He submitted that when IPCL was a Company it
was a Government of India undertaking and in view of Article 16(4) of the Constitution of India, IPCL used to make some resolutions
of employees in category of Scheduled Castes/ Scheduled Tribes. That continued upto 2002 when the Company was working and
thereafter due to demerger reliance took over 26% share of the Company. Even thereafter also Resolution in favour of SC/ST was
continued.
7.1 However, when they felt that IPCL is going to be merged with Reliance Industries Limited, Transferee Company, they filed
Special Civil Application No. 10045 of 2007 and prayed for certain directions. When the matter reached hearing before
this Court, this Court passed order in 8th May, 2007 with direction that SC/ST persons should make representation to the
Secretary, Ministry of Chemicals & Petrochemicals, New Delhi and the Secretary, Ministry of Finance - Department of
Disinvestment. The learned advocate has submitted that accordingly they already made representation dated 5.6.2007
to both these authorities. He has produced some of the documents. The learned advocate has to file a short affidavit
putting those facts on this record. He has prayed that some time may be granted. The prayer is granted. He therefore
submitted that whatever arrangement and agreement which was entered into between IPCL and SC/ST employees right
from 1969 which was continued till today, the same may be continued. He further submitted that whatever order the Central
Government passes in the representation which they filed before the Government of India, the said final order will be
binding to the Transferee Company.
WORKERS’ SUBMISSIONS: [Submission of Mr. Girish Patel, ld. sr. advocate]
8.1. As regards Company Application No. 260 of 2007, the same is filed by IPCL Employees Association and IPCL Employees
Union. All the applicants are Trade Union of Workers working in IPCL with a prayer to direct the Managements of the
Transferor Company and the Transferee Company to hold consultations / discussions / negotiations with the applicants
on the issues highlighted by the applicants vide their letter dated 10.4.2007. In support of the same affidavit of senior Vice
President of the applicant No. 1 Association has been filed. In this matter this Court passed order on 19.6.2007 that the
present application be treated as objection to the scheme.
8.2. The present Company Application (Company Application No. 260 of 2007) involves the question of fate of about 5000
employees / workmen who have served in the IPCL (Transferor Company) for the last 20 to 30 years, facing the sudden
disappearance of their Company and their absorption in Reliance Industries Limited (Transferee Company), a new entity
under a different master. The central question raised by the applicants is what is the scope for concern for the workers/
employees of the Company or Companies in any scheme of arrangement, amalgamation, compromise etc. within the
purview of Sections 391 to 394 of the Companies Act, 1956.
8.3. Company Petition No. 93 of 2007 is filed by the IPCL praying for sanction of the Court for the scheme of amalgamation
of the IPCL Company with Reliance Industries Limited. The IPCL is a leading profit making enterprise. Originally, it was
Government of India enterprise, a leading public sector undertaking which was acclaimed as one of the Navratnas.
However, as a result of the disinvestment of the Company in about June, 2002, the Reliance Petro-Investment Limited
(strategic partner), an associate Company of the Reliance Industries Limited has acquired at present shares of 46.57% in
the IPCL. It must be noted that IPCL is a profit making enterprise and did not and does not face any financial problems at
the time of proposed amalgamation. Similarly, the Reliance Industries Limited is one of the largest private sector industrial
enterprise in India and ranks among world’s top 10 producers for most of the products. It can be considered as a giant
globalised corporation.
8.4. It is submitted that the basic features of the proposed scheme of amalgamation are enumerated on page 8 of the Company
Petition and the Scheme is reproduced on page 49 (Annexure-G of the Company Petition). As per this Scheme, the
appointed date is 1.4.2006. Clause 1.12 defines “undertaking” so as to include “all employees engaged in or relating to
transferor Company’s business and operations”. Clause 4.1 provides for transfer of undertaking of the transferor Company
as a going concern with all assets, liabilities, obligations and employees. Clause B(a) deals with rationale for the Scheme
namely, to achieve more efficiency, economy, benefit of scale, higher productivity, rational allocation and utilization of the
resources, etc. However, Clause B (Government) reads as under:
“The amalgamated entity will benefit from improved organization capability and leadership, arising from the combination
of people from IPCL and Reliance Industries Limited who have diverse skills, talent and best experience to compete
successfully in an increasingly competitive industry (pages 18 & 19 of the Company Petition). Clause 7.2 imposes
restrictions upon IPCL in the meanwhile (page 68). Clause 8 specifically deals with the employees of IPCL (pages 13 & 70
of the Company Petition). Clause 13 provides for dissolution of IPCL without winding up.”
8.5. The question raised by the Unions is whether did the workers stand in the new amalgamated Company as erstwhile
workmen of the IPCL (Transferor Company) and as employees absorbed in the Reliance Industries Limited (Transferee
Company).
MAIN CONTENTIONS OF THE WORKERS:
9.1 The workers being a very important part of a going concern, namely, IPCL, have a right to be consulted or to be taken into
confidence (evidence) or who have participated in the amalgamation proceedings going on between the two Companies. In
the present case, the workers are not involved at all in the proceedings by the IPCL. Not only that but even they were never
informed nor given any opportunity nor was there any response to the written grievances given by the workers of IPCL.
9.2 The Scheme of amalgamation in question does not even mention the right or freedom of workers regarding the option
whether to join the transferee Company or not. Their main question is if any workman is not interested in joining the
Reliance Industries Limited (Transferee Company) what would be the nature of his refusal? Would it be resignation,
termination, or retrenchment? The scheme and the prayer made by the Company before the Court simply provides that the
workers of IPCL shall become the workers of the Reliance Industries Limited on the granting of sanction. This amounts to
treating the workers as simply chattels who can be shunted from one place to other.
137
9.3 Even if the IPCL clarifies that the workers have freedom not to join the Reliance Industries Limited, this option is in fact
illusory as the workers have worked with IPCL for the last 20 to 25 years and at this stage, they cannot get out and do not
have good prospects for any alternative employment. The plight of the workers at this stage makes it more important and
necessary for conclusion with the employees by the IPCL when the scheme of amalgamation is proposed and negotiated.
9.4 As the workers of IPCL are directly affected by the Scheme of amalgamation and when by virtue of the scheme the
employees of IPCL will become the employees of the Reliance Industries Limited and when the prayer of the IPCL before
the Court in its Company Petition is for an order of the Court to declare that the employees of IPCL will become the
employees of Reliance Industries Limited, in other words when they asked for the order of the Court to this effect, the
workers have every right to raise objections and come before the Court and there can be no objection against the right of
the workers who appear in the Court and object in any scheme of amalgamation, the workers have a locus standi to object
to the scheme either in whole or in part.
9.5 The existing rights and interests of the employees of IPCL with inbuilt potential development or growth have not been
properly considered, discussed and protected. Mere clause 8 in general terms does not satisfy the grievances of the
workers.
9.6 That part of Clause 8 which is described by the IPCL as only clarificatory is absolutely obnoxious, unjust and confiscatory
of the rights of the workers. The IPCL which is the employer of the workmen has no business to tell the workmen that even
though he becomes the employee of Reliance Industries Limited, he will not be entitled to any scheme of employment or
other benefits available to the employees of Reliance Industries Limited.
9.7 The workers of IPCL may not perhaps claim that there must be guarantee against future events but have every right to raise
questions regarding the immediate impact of the transfer of employees from IPCL to Reliance Industries Limited and they
have not been sufficiently taken care.
9.8 The specific concerns expressed by the workers of IPCL before IPCL and before the Court can be taken of and ought to be
taken care of at the very stage of amalgamation and for these grievances, they cannot be compelled to wait for complete
amalgamation and avail of alternative remedy like Labour Court etc.
9.9 If the legitimate rights and interests of the workers of IPCL have not been fairly, reasonably, and justly considered, that part
of the Scheme is definitely against the public interest and public policy.
THE LEARNED SR. COUNSEL’S FURTHER SUBMISSION:
10. It is submitted that the principal contentions of the applicants on behalf of the workers of IPCL should be understood and appreciated
in the context of the development in the sphere of corporate system, Company Law and World Economic System. It is, therefore,
submitted that while dealing with the contentions of the workers, the following aspects are very important.
10.1 One of the central questions of Company Law discussed in the various countries and in India:
10.2 Have workers no place in the affairs of the Company except as sellers of wage labour ? Are they considered as dead assets
to be treated like machines, goods, buildings, contracts, assets etc. or are they required to be treated as living human
beings who spend large number of years with the Company ?
10.3 The important distinction between labour and capital (capital coming from shareholders and creditors) is that in the case of
capital, the owner can be separated or delinked from the capital but in the case of labour, their physical and mental labour
cannot be separated from human personality. A company is not merely purchasing wage labour but is engaging a total
human being.
10.4 It is also recognized that a modern corporation or a company is not a business enterprise working for profits only but is
a living social institution and integral part of socio-economic life of the community and therefore its birth, death, success
or failure, working methods, operations, and dealings have wild repercussions in the society and are not confined to the
economic interest of those who have supplied capital. It is also recognized that a modern corporation has to recognize,
respect and promote not only the interest of shareholders or creditors but of different classes of people in the society.
The important elements of modern corporation are promoters, shareholders, creditors, directors, manager, workers,
consumers, State, society and the world. For example, the Company Law has to tackle the problems of shareholders’
genuine democracy and workers’ participation in the management.
10.5 In the age of new economic policy viz., liberaliation, privatization, and globalization and in the light of the rise of giant
model, national and multi-national, the working and dealing of these Corporations cannot be completely left to themselves
and cannot be considered as purely internal matters of the Corporation and their Directors and shareholders. These
Corporations are in the modern world very important centres of private power - sometimes more powerful than the States
themselves. Therefore, the question of social responsibilities of the modern Corporation and the availability of the basic
human rights against these Corporations known as non-State actors are the burning problems of new International Law of
Human Rights and Constitutions in many countries.
10.6 It is also recognised that a modern enterprise is the result of combined efforts of labour and capital. One cannot work
without the other and therefore they are considered as almost partners in the business enterprise. Both equally contribute
to the productivity of the company and its development and therefore equal status of both is recognized and must be
recognized by the dynamic Company Law. Just as shareholders claim that “X” or “Y” is their Company, the workers also
have a legitimate right to claim that “X” is their Company. In fact, the workers are much more important than capital because
as living human beings, they spent the most fruitful years of the life with the Company. Their very existence, their life, their
identity, their personality and their future are intimately connected with the Company’s life. Shareholders ultimately in the
modern world are considered as mere passive recipients of dividends and nothing more. While the workers’ life and every
day of the working years are associated with the working of the Company. It is, therefore, submitted that the very life and
death of the company are of great importance to the workers and therefore the workers in a Company Law cannot be totally
ignored.
10.7 Even the Constitution of India and the statutory laws of the country have also recognized the rights and interests of the
workers in a modern corporation and society.
138
(a) Art. 43A of the Constitution of India provides “the State shall take steps, by suitable legislation or in other way,
to secure the participation of workers in the management of undertakings, establishments or other organizations
engaged in any industry”. This is one of the Directive Principles of the State Policy and is declared to be a
fundamental principle in the governance of the country and is equally of importance to the Courts administering
justice.
(b) The Hon’ble Supreme Court of India has also interpreted Article 21 of the Constitution of India, right to life as right
to know merely to existence but right to live with human dignity and has included a number of Directive Principles
of State Policy as the constituent element of right to life. One of these is the empowerment of the workers. How
workers are treated by their Company and by the Company Law is certainly a matter of human dignity and no one
can be a party to any practice or rules which are derogatory to the dignity of a human being.
(c) He submitted that Articles 39 of the Constitution of India provides certain Directive Principles of State Policy to
be followed by the State, namely that men and women equally have the right to an adequate means of livelihood;
that the ownership and control of the material resources of the community are so distributed as best to subserve
the common good; that the operation of the economic system does not result in the concentration of wealth and
means of production to the common detriment and others. Article 41 provides right to work, to education and
to public assistance in certain cases by the State. Article 42 provides provision for just and humane conditions
of work and maternity relief. Article 43 provides living, wage, etc. for workers. Article 46 of the Constitution of
India provides promotion of educational and economic interests of Scheduled Castes, Scheduled Tribes and other
weaker Sections. All these Articles lay down various essential rights of workers which are considered to be the
constituent element of right to live with human dignity in various judgements of the Hon’ble Supreme Court.
(d) He has also invited the attention of this Court to the provisions of the Industrial Disputes Act, 1947 particularly
Section 3A which has been introduced by Gujarat 21 of 1972 with effect from 20.1.1973 which provides Joint
Management Council. Section 3B provides functions of the Council. The said amended Section 3A provides for
establishing Joint Management Council representing the employer and the workers and has tried to implement
Article 43A by way of statutory provisions securing workers’ participation in the management.
(e) Even Chapters 5-A of the I.D. Act provides for lay off and retrenchment and 5-B provides for special provisions
relating to lay off, retrenchment and closure in certain establishments. The said Chapters 5A and 5B of the I.D.
Act have made specific provisions with respect to the power of the management to effect lay off and to retrench
the workers or to close down the industry. These are the co- issues of the traditional right of the management but
the Act has also intruded into the realm of managerial prerogative by prescribing the necessity of prior permission
before any such actions taken by the management.
10.8 It is, therefore, submitted that while interpreting Sections 391 to 394 of the Companies Act, and particularly the workers
concerned in the scheme of amalgamation between two Companies, the Companies themselves and the Court and to take
into consideration these latest developments in the world of Company Law particularly towards participatory management
on the part of the workers and humanization of law.
10.9 The learned advocate has relied on the following decisions:
(1) MUNICIPAL COUNCIL, DAMOH VS. M/S. VRAJ LAL MANILAL & CO. reported AIR 1982 SC P. 844 (paras 47 and
48)
(2) SUBHASH CHAND JAIN VS. DELHI ELECTRIC SUPPLY UNDERTAKING & OTHERS reported in AIR 1981 SC
75 (paras 4, 6, 8 and 92)
(3) GUJARAT KAMDAR SAHAKARI MANDAL AND OTHERS VS. RAMKRISHNA MILLS LTD. (1998) 92 Company
Cases pages 692 & 711.
THE ROLE OF THE COMPANY UNDER SECTIONS 391 TO 394 OF THE COMPANIES ACT:
11. The different leading judgements of the Hon’ble Supreme Court and the High Courts have specifically dealt with and determined
the specific role of the Company Court while granting sanction to any scheme of arrangement, compromise and amalgamation in
relation to a company under Sections 391 to 394 of the Companies Act. The basic principles which emerged from these judgements
are as under:
11.1 Under Sections 391-394 of the Companies Act, in the case of arrangement, compromise and amalgamation in relation to
a company, the application can be made only by the shareholders or creditors.
11.2 If in such scheme the sanction of the Company Court is a mandatory requirement.
11.3 Unlike United Kingdom, the Scheme of amalgamation is not left to the shareholders and creditors but the law recognizes
the importance of concerns over and above the interest of shareholders and creditors and their monetary interest.
11.4 It is also established that the Company Court is not merely a rubber stamp or a registering authority but has an independent
supervisory role to ensure that all statutory requirements are complied with, that the scheme is just, fair and reasonable
which prudent business management would approve, and the scheme is not opposed to public policy or public interest.
11.5 Therefore, the Companies Court has a dual role (1) as an umpire to ensure that the claim is fairly played and is not guided
merely by the simple majority role, all interests are properly considered and consulted and represented; and (2) as protector
of public policy or public interest.
11.6 Though it is recognized that the Company Court does not have appellate power while sanctioning the amalgamation scheme
but only supervisory power, this supervisory power as is pointed out above is not merely power of rubber stamp or registering
amalgamation scheme. Supervisory power is itself an important power of the Court.
11.7 Moreover, this power of the Court is not merely one- time supervision but even continuous supervision to see that the
compromise or arrangement is carried out under Section 392, the Court has got power to give directions or make suggestions
in the scheme as it may consider necessary for the proper working of the compromise or arrangement. And this power can
be exercised by the Company Court not only at the time of sanction but also at any time thereafter.
139
WORKERS’ POSITION AND STATUS IN THE PROPOSED SCHEME OF AMALGAMATION:
12. It is submitted that the workers of the Company or Companies proposing any scheme of amalgamation and praying for Court’s
sanction have an important role to play.
12.1 A scheme of amalgamation is not a unilateral scheme or action by one company only like internal organization or
arrangement but as a result of agreement between the Transferor Company (IPCL) and the Transferee Company (Reliance
Industries Limited). It is in fact an agreement between the shareholders and creditors of both Companies and the terms
and conditions of the scheme are the subject matter of negotiation between the two Companies and are not dictated
by one company alone. Both Companies jointly work out the proposed scheme and then, after securing the consent of
necessary parties, approach the Court for sanction. If this is the situation, the workers of the Transferor Company, (IPCL)
can become a topic of mutual discussion not merely by Transferor Company but also by Transferee Company. In such
mutual agreement of transfer between two companies, the workers of one Company cannot be totally ignored or excluded.
And there is no statutory prohibition in the Companies Act excluding the workers completely from participation in the
proceedings. The fallacy of the judgements arises from the defective approach to consider the scheme as if it is a unilateral
act by the transferor Company.
12.2 Once the Company presents the scheme of amalgamation before the Company Court and once the Company Court grants
sanction, the scheme does not simply remain an agreement binding upon those who agree but becomes binding upon all
whether they agree or not. Therefore, while sanctioning the scheme of amalgamation if the Court would perform the role of
sanction, the Court can very well consider the concerns interests and rights of the workers of the Company.
12.3 As a result of the amalgamation, the undertaking of the transferor company is completely transferred to the transferee
company and this undertaking will also include all its workmen and secondly the transferor company will be dissolved
without being wound up.
12.4 As a result of amalgamation, the transferor Company will completely cease to exist and its identity is completely lost and
after amalgamation, the transferee company becomes a new entity as a result of combination of both the Companies. It will
have new identity, new structure, new set up and it will have a clear and large impact upon the workers of the Transferor
Company because the employer of the employees goes out and the employees get a new employer under whom they have
to work. As they are not merely passive absence recipient of dividends or claims of their credits and interest but they have
to work with new company, they are vitally interested in their position in the new set up.
12.5 If the scheme of amalgamation is considered and the Company Petition is looked at, the employees of IPCL will become
directly the employees of Reliance Industries Limited and this will be not by virtue of the agreement of the workers but by
the scheme of amalgamation undertaken by the two companies and by virtue of the sanction to be given by the Court.
12.6 It follows that if this is going to be the impact of amalgamation upon the employees of IPCL, they cannot be treated like
chattels to be bought and sold at the whim of the employer nor can they be treated like slaves.
12.7 The scheme of amalgamation is ultimately a scheme of rationalization of the organizational and operational system of a
company and right from the beginning, the matter of rationalization always involves the conflict between the employer and
the workers. While the employers want flexibility, freedom of action, desire for rationalization and economy, restructuring
and reallocation, diversion of resources from one area to another area, mere economic and rational utilization of resources
etc., the workers always are interested and demand reasonable security of service, steady and increasing wages,
reasonable protection against insecurity and uncertainty etc. Traditionally, the former is put in the realm of Company Law
and the latter is always included in the sphere of Industrial Law, as it is rightly said that managerial prerogatives under the
Company Law are tampered with insurgency of the labour.
12.8 It is therefore submitted that the Company Court dealing with any question regarding Company Law and particularly the
scheme of amalgamation ought to consider the different laws operating in the field and reconcile the conflicting interest and
create a balance, as it is said the law is a science of social engineering.
12.9 As the Company Court is statutorily concerned with the public interest aspect of the scheme of amalgamation, the workers’
interest also must be considered because (1) the interests of the workers constitute a part and parcel of fair, just and reasonable
scheme and part of public policy (2) public policy or public interest does also include workers’ interest who represent a
significant section or segment of the company (3) public policy also includes constitutional policy and while discussing the
question of public policy, the Court also has to keep in mind the constitutional policy as declared in the Preamble Part III
(fundamental rights) and Part IV (Directive Principles of State Policy) and Part-IVA (fundamental duties). Participation of
workers in the management, workers’ dignity and workers’ rights are therefore a part and parcel of constitutional policy
and the Company Court, a part of the High Court, cannot ignore this constitutional policy, (4) even a prudent business
management test does require serious and sensitive concern for the interest and rights of the workers because the
satisfaction and welfare of the workers is an essential part of sound management policy. Discontent, disgruntle, alienated
and segregated work force cannot be considered to be in the interest of enterprise. The scheme of amalgamation between
IPCL and Reliance industries Limited has discussed the rationale of amalgamation. Clause B(g) on page 18 of the
Company Petition refers to one advantage viz. “The amalgamated entity will benefit from improved organization capability
and leadership, arising from the combination of people from IPCL and Reliance Industries Limited who have diverse skills,
talent and best experience to compete successfully in an increasingly competitive industry”.
12.10 The simple question of the workers of IPCL (Transferor Company) is therefore that if the Reliance Industries Limited
(Transferee Company) is going to have the benefit of diverse skills, talent and experience of IPCL employees which will be
used in the transferee Company, why can their interest (i.e. workers) be not considered at the stage of amalgamation even
with regard to the transferee Company. If the Transferee Company, Reliance Industries Limited is going to have the benefit
of the employees of the IPCL, it must also be prepared to accept the responsibility towards these workmen and assured in
the scheme itself.
12.11 The relevant judgements covering the interest of workers are:
(1) PANCHMAHALS STEEL LTD. VS. UNIVERSAL STEEL TRADERS reported in 46 Company Cases 706 (Coram:
D.A. Desai, J)
140
(2) In re HATHISING MANUFACTURING COMPANY LTD. (IN LIQUIDATION) reported in (1976) 46 Company Cases
p. 59 - p. 66 (D.A. DESAI, J)
(3) MANSUKHLAL VS. M.V. SHAH, OFFICIAL LIQUIDATOR, LIQUIDATOR OF HATHISING MFG. CO. LTD., (IN
LIQUIDATION) AND OTHERS reported in (1976) 46 Company Cases 279 (D.A. DESAI, J)
(4) HINDUSTAN LEVER EMPLOYEES UNION VS. HINDUSTAN LEVER LTD. & OTHERS reported in (1995) 83
Company Cases p. 30 - p. 39 (SC)
(5) GUJARAT NYLONS LTD. reported in 1992 (1) GLH p. 637
(6) In re NARMADA CHEMATUR PETROCHEMICALS LTD., unreported judgement in Company Petition No. 147 of
2006 decided on 9.1.2007 by this Court Coram: M.R. Shah, J).
(7) BLUE STAR LIMITED (2001) 104 Company Cases p. 371.
12.12 It is submitted that the first three cases, namely, PANCHMAHALS STEEL LTD. VS. UNIVERSAL STEEL TRADERS
(supra); In re HATHISING MANUFACTURING COMPANY LTD. (IN LIQUIDATION) (supra); MANSUKHLAL VS. M.V.
SHAH, OFFICIAL LIQUIDATOR, LIQUIDATOR OF HATHISING MFG. CO. LTD., (IN LIQUIDATION) AND OTHERS (supra)
show concern for the workers while the latter cases, namely, HINDUSTAN LEVER EMPLOYEES UNION VS. HINDUSTAN
LEVER LTD. & OTHERS (supra); GUJARAT NYLONS LTD. (supra); In re NARMADA CHEMATUR PETROCHEMICALS
LTD. (supra); BLUE STAR LIMITED (supra) deal with the rights and interest of the workers in the transferor Company.
It is submitted that these later cases have considered the interest and welfare of the workers as one of the concerns of
the Company Judge and in a given case, they have held that the particular clause takes care of the workers’ interest but
ultimately the Court was concerned with the fair treatment and what is fair treatment or what are the standards of fairness
cannot be mechanically laid down and have not been laid down by any of the judgements. If the judgements are read as
a whole, the Court’s consideration of the clause regarding protection of existing rights and the statements made by the
Companies’ lawyers regarding assurance to the employees, it might satisfy the requirement of fair treatment in that case.
12.13 It is submitted that thus while considering the question of fair treatment to the workers, various aspects have to be
considered and fair treatment is not a strait- jacket formula to be applied mechanically. Ultimately, it depends upon the
facts and circumstances of the case.
The grievances and demands of IPCL before the IPCL (Transferor Company) and before this Court:
EFFECT OF SCHEME ON WORKERS:
13.1 It is submitted that as the scheme of amalgamation of IPCL with Reliance Industries Limited will have a deep and pervasive
impact upon the position and status of employees of IPCL and as the employer of the workers will be changed from IPCL to
Reliance Industries Limited, and as by virtue of the scheme itself and the order of the Court, the employees of the IPCL will
become the employees of the Reliance Industries Limited, the employees of IPCL have clear legal standing or locus standi
to object the scheme of amalgamation. Secondly, the statutory provisions of the Indian Companies Act do not specifically
and explicitly or even by necessary implication prohibited the standing of the workers in such proceedings under Sections
391 to 394. It is strange that the transferor and transferee companies pray for forcible transfer of workers of IPCL to Reliance
Industries Limited and yet they challenged the very standing of the workers to object the same. This Court’s (Coram: M.R.
Shah, J) judgement mentioned above specifically recognizes the locus standi of the workers. The Bombay High Court in
KAMANI EMPLOYEES UNION case reported in (2000) 1 Company Law Journal p. 351 specifically recognized the right of the
workers and locus standi of the workers and various other judgements cited while considering objections of the workers
except the standing of the workers.
13.2 It is further submitted that by virtue of Clause 8 of the Scheme, the employees of the IPCL from effective date shall
directly become the employees of Reliance Industries Limited and similarly the Company Petition of IPCL also prays for
the order of the Court to make the employees of the IPCL employees of the Reliance Industries Limited. The Scheme
does not even whisper about choice of freedom of the workers. It is well recognized (referring to the decision in the case
of NOKES AND OKES VS. DONCASTER AMALGAMATED COLLIRIES (11 Company Cases 83) and JAWAHARLAL
NEHRU UNIVERSITY VS. K.S. JAWATKAR reported in AIR 1989N SC 1577) that the workers of one employer company
cannot be forcibly transferred to another employer or employee company. This will be nothing but bonded labour or slaves.
This also shows the approach of the Companies towards their employees. When the Company is transferring its employees
to another employer, the Company does not have even courtesy to ask them whether any of them would like to join the new
company or not. It is not a question of only choice but it is a question of dignity of the person himself.
13.3 As a result of this absence of choice or option, the workers have a legitimate concern viz., if any worker does not want to join a
new company, what will be the nature of his refusal or unwillingness? Would it be abandonment of job, resignation, termination
or retrenchment, the workers’ right depend upon the answer to this question and suppose the workers refuse to join and if
it is treated as retrenchment, who will pay the retrenchment compensation, whether IPCL or Reliance Industries Limited.
13.4 It is submitted that the scheme is totally silent on this aspect and therefore is defective.
13.5 It is true that even if the scheme provides for option whether to join or not to join the transferee Company viz. Reliance
Industries Limited, the option will definitely be illusory for most of the workers because it takes away their very means of
livelihood. The employees have worked with IPCL for 20 to 25 years and after such long service and at middle age, it is
absolutely unjust and cruel for the Companies not to worry about their future. The workers cannot easily ge out and seek
jobs in the economy of unemployment. Therefore, from both the points of view, viz., silence about the scheme of option
recognizing in principle the very dignity of the workers and their freedom and the unfortunate reality of unemployment
which unwilling workers will have to face, the scheme is unfair, unreasonable and unjust as it fails to take into consideration
the serious concerns of what can be described as captive workers. It amounts to nothing less than exploitation of and
blackmailing the workers. This inequitable part has to be considered.
13.6 It is submitted that considering the absence of option offered by the Company on the event of amalgamation and the
illusory character of option if given, it follows that the workers of IPCL are entitled to be consulted in the process of
negotiations of the amalgamation. In the present case, the workers have never been informed about the proposed scheme
141
of amalgamation, they have never been given any details of the same, they have been kept far away from the negotiation
proceedings, they have never been given notice regarding the same nor the opportunity to represent the case and never
allowed to participate. The workers’ submission is that not only that they have right to come to the Court by raising objection
to the scheme after scheme is finalized but they have also right to make representation and to be involved when the
scheme itself is considered by both the Companies. This is the very essence of fair treatment. It may be that the workers’
demand may not be considered fully or partly but that cannot exclude the workers totally from the negotiating table. The
scheme must be fair, just and reasonable and in law and aspect which is more important even then the content of the
scheme is the procedural aspect viz., participation of the workers in the process. In other words, the aspect of rational
decision making process.
13.7 This participation of the workers before the stage of amalgamation is required for two reasons - (1) the right of human
dignity demands it - what is known as intrinsic value of natural justice in the wider sense of participation and (2) the workers
having long experience and skills can definitely contribute more significantly to the nature of the scheme and the advantage
of the transferor Company in any scheme of amalgamation and particularly in the bargaining process. And this contribution
of the workers who are inside the Company for the last 20 to 25 years will be of greater value when the participation of the
exclusive shareholders and dividend seeking creditors.
13.8 It is submitted that these two contentions of the workers, viz., their demand for being heard by the Court itself and their
demand for being consulted by the Company itself are totally different from each other. The first is the question of natural
justice before the Court, the second concerns the right of broad participation of the affected persons in the decision making
process by the company itself. The present proceedings have denied the workers both the things.
13.9 It is submitted that as the employees of the IPCL have served the Company for a long period and the IPCL is benefited
from their devotion and commitment to work and sincerity and from their experience, skills and knowledge, the successful
working of the IPCL and its recognition as one among “Navratna” is certainly attributed to the hard and committed work of
the employees. When the transferor Company in its legal form decides to extinguish itself and merge into another company,
that transferor company as a model employer having been benefited by the workers has a duty of fair representation of its
workers’ interest in any bargaining process with the transferor company. The workers of IPCL before amalgamation cannot
directly ask for protection of their rights and interest from the transferee company which has still not become their employer
but they have a legitimate right to expect and demand their interest and rights as employees of transferor company will be
properly represented by their employer IPCL and IPCL who extracts as much advantage for the workers as possible in any
bargaining process. In this task, the IPCL has totally failed and it is respectfully submitted that while considering the impact
of the scheme upon the workers of IPCL, the Company Court should also consider the failure on the part of the IPCL to act
as a real spokesman of the workers (1) workers’ existing rights and (2) workers’ interest in the Reliance Industries Limited
(Transferee Company).
13.10 As regards the existing rights of the employees of the IPCL, Clause 8 provides four things (1) no break or interruption
in service i.e. continuity of service; (2) the terms and conditions shall not be less favourable than those in the transferor
company; (3) respecting all settlements, agreements etc., between the employees of the IPCL and IPCL; and (4) Pension
fund, Provident Fund shall be transferred to the Reliance Industries Limited.
13.11 It is submitted that this is a general clause seeking to protect the interests of the workers of IPCL but the terms and
conditions of employment are complex and unless they are analyzed in specific details, a general omnibus clause cannot
effectively deal with various rights and interests provided for and protected by the terms and conditions of employment.
Moreover, these terms and conditions are not stagnant but there is also inbuilt scope for development.
13.12 This is reason why the employees of IPCL came to know about the proposed scheme of amalgamation (it must be noted
that they were never informed nor were they given any notice nor were they invited for any discussion), they submitted
representations to the IPCL regarding their position and wrote a letter dated 10.4.2007 (Annexure-V to the Company
Application p. 98) to the IPCL enumerating a number of their concerns, uncertainties apprehensions if the amalgamation
scheme goes through.
13.13 Unfortunately, the transferor Company viz., IPCL even in the early stage of the proceedings of amalgamation, did not even
bother to take note of this representation dated 10.4.2007, did not even spare time to give in writing its response, not to say
about calling them for discussion. The IPCL therefore seems to have taken view by providing a general phrase or a clause
workers will be satisfied.
13.14 The employees have specifically dealt with each grievance or complaint or concern and during the course of arguments
before the Court, they have given a detailed analysis of each of the concerns and demand of the workers. These demands
do not pertain to the future demands by the employees after amalgamation but they are the grievances to be responded
to and to be dealt with at the very stage of amalgamation, so that the workers may know what their position is from the
effective date.
13.15 It is further submitted that when the IPCL was contemplating and was taking steps for proposing and carrying out a scheme
of amalgamation with the Reliance Industries Limited, the IPCL ought to have taken the workers into confidence, called
them for discussion and should have tried to settle all rights arising from the existing rights so that the workers can look
forward to better prospects in a new company, as it is pointed out about that the rights are not stagnating but they are
growing and the workers’ grievance was that by simply providing that the workers will continue to be employed on terms
and conditions not less favourable will not meet the legitimate grievance of the employees because it would mean that the
workers’ rights and interests would be stagnated and would be fossilised.
13.16 It is natural that if IPCL were in real sense an independent entity, it would have perhaps dealt with the workers’ grievances,
settled the demands before the scheme of amalgamation but in the present case, IPCL itself is controlled by the Reliance
Industries Limited, it was not interested in settling the demands of the workers before amalgamation. The embargo upon
the IPCL (Transferor Company) against changing the terms and conditions of the employees without explicit consent of
the Reliance Industries Limited during the period between the date of filing the application and effective date makes it
impossible for IPCL to settle the demands of the workers before amalgamation and the result would be that even the existing
terms and conditions will be thrown out to the mercy of the transferee Company.
142
13.17 So the grievance of the employees of IPCL regarding their existing position is best summarized as under:
13.18 As regards the provident funds, pension funds, superannuation funds, etc. the scheme provides for protection of
the funds to be utilized for the benefit of the employees of the IPCL but the scheme gives discretion to the Reliance
Industries Limited (Transferee Company) to keep these funds of IPCL employees either separately or to mix up with
the similar funds of the Reliance Industries Limited. This is not acceptable to the employees of the IPCL because
merging of these funds of IPCL at Vadodara with the similar funds of Reliance Industries Limited at Mumbai will create
several practical problems for the IPCL employees to whom these funds belong.
13.19 As regards the IPCL employees’ position in the transferee Company on the coming into effect of the scheme, the IPCL
employees have strong objection to that part of Clause 8 which reads as under:
13.20 “It is clarified that the employees of the transferor company who become employees of the transferee Company by virtue of
this scheme, shall not be entitled to the employment policies and shall not be entitled to avail of any schemes and benefits
that may be applicable and available to any of the employees of the transferee company (including the benefits of or under
any Employee Stock Option Schemes applicable to or covering of or any employees of the transferee company), unless
otherwise determined by the transferee Company”. This provision in Clause 8 is seriously objected to by the employees of
the IPCL on the following grounds:
(a) The first part of Clause 8 declares that the employees of the IPCL will automatically and directly become the
employees of the Reliance Industries Limited (Transferee Company) as a result of the Scheme of amalgamation
but the second part of the clause says that you will not be eligible or entitled to the benefit of employment policies
or other benefits etc., available to the employees of the Reliance Industries Limited. It is submitted that this is a
contradictory provision in the same Scheme. By one hand, IPCL employees become the employees of Reliance
Industries Limited and by other hand, they are prevented from the benefit of the employees of the Reliance
Industries Limited.
(b) It is expected that IPCL as the employer of the IPCL employees should have considered and given serious
thought to the position of its own employees in the transferee company upon amalgamation. Instead, the IPCL
(Transferor Company) seeks to protect and look after the interests of the transferee company by preventing its
own employees from getting the benefits of Reliance Industries Limited. What business has the IPCL which is
going to die to lay down this condition for the employees who are going to be transferred to Reliance Industries
Limited?
(c) This part of the clause will block the future claims of the employees of the IPCL when they demand the benefits
available to the Reliance Industries Limited employees. The question is not whether the IPCL employees can claim
the benefits of Reliance Industries Limited employees in future and will get the same or not is a different question
but at the very stage of amalgamation, the workers of IPCL cannot be blocked and prevented from claiming such
benefits by a provision in the scheme itself which will be binding upon all persons. It means that in future also
when erstwhile employees of IPCL would claim such benefits from Reliance Industries Limited, this clause will
be used to prevent the workers from claiming such benefits because this prohibitory clause will be binding upon
the employees of IPCL. The right of the IPCL employees to raise demands for equality before Reliance Industries
Limited is sought to be taken away permanently at the very outset. This is obnoxious and cannot be permitted.
(d) On the one hand, it is argued that it is not the function of the scheme of amalgamation at the stage of sanction to
provide for your future rights in the transferee Company but at the same time this very scheme of amalgamation in its
inception, prevents us from demanding benefits of Reliance Industries Limited employees. If the scheme can provide
for such a prohibitory clause, it can very well provide for the permissive clauses and enabling clauses for the IPCL
employees to claim such status. It is, therefore, not true to say that considering the rights and interests of the transferor
Company as regards the transferee Company after amalgamation cannot be a part of the scheme and would not fall
within the company jurisdiction under Sections 391-394 of the Companies Act.
(e) This part of the clause is also unjust and unfair because the transferee Company will enjoy all the benefits of the
experience, talent, skills and training of the IPCL employees after amalgamation but Reliance Industries Limited
would not guarantee any rights or interests to the IPCL employees.
(f) It is the legitimate concern of the IPCL employees which must be taken into consideration viz. how shall the
IPCL employees be treated in Reliance Industries Limited after amalgamation? The IPCL employees cannot be
segregated as a distinct species to be preserved till extinction. The demand of the IPCL employees is that after the
amalgamation, they cannot be treated as second class employees.
(g) Moreover, it is forgotten that after amalgamation, the IPCL employees are concerned in two different two things:
(1) the immediate impact of amalgamation, and (2) their future demands. It may be that the demands which might
be made by the employees in future, may be taken care of by approaching appropriate forum, such as demand
in rise of wages or better conditions of service but the questions regarding immediate impact are not of this
character, such as the benefit of the IPCL employees in the Reliance Industries Limited set up, the question of their
seniority, the question of their promotions, the status of the unions and their recognition etc. As they are immediate
impact of amalgamation, it has been found that in a large number of statutory organizations or amalgamation, the
statute or the subordinate legislation specifically deal with the adjustment of the rights of the different companies
or entities to be organized or amalgamated e.g. the nationalization of Life Insurance Corporation or General
 Insurance Companies.
Additional submission of learned counsel Mr.Girish Patel on behalf of workers of four trade Unions after
Mr. K.S. Nanavati, ld. SR. COUNSEL’S reply to the above submission in rejoinder
14. The proposed Scheme of Amalgamation should not be sanctioned till the following directions are complied with:
14.1 The issues raised by the applicants are resolved to the satisfaction of the applicants.
143
14.2 The Managements of the Transferor Company (IPCL) and the Transferee Company (Reliance Industries Limited) hold
discussions/consultations/negotiations with the applicants on the issue highlighted by the applicants vide their letter dated
10.4.2007 (Annexure-III) and other issues that they raise.
14.3 The workers of the Transferor Company (IPCL) before being automatically transferred, must be given option of retrenchment
and / or retirement scheme with all the incidental payments if any of them does not want to join the Reliance Industries
Limited and the IPCL and Reliance Industries Limited accept the unwillingness to join the Reliance Industries Limited as
retrenchment under the Industrial Disputes Act, 1947, with all legal payments including retrenchment, compensation or he
must be offered all benefits of voluntary retirement.
14.4 Clause 8 of the Scheme must also include the provisions with respect to grievances of the applicants contained in their
letter of 10.4.2007 and other issues that the applicants may raise and as agreed upon by the parties.
14.5 The Provident Funds, Pension Funds, etc. mentioned in clause 8(b) of the IPCL must be kept separate and should not be
merged except with the consent of the applicants.
14.6 All disputes arising from the present settlements/agreement which the Reliance Industries Limited has agreed to abide by
must be resolved before the Scheme is sanctioned.
14.7 The objectionable part of clause 8 beginning with “It is clarified” and ending with “Transferee Company” must be deleted.
14.8 The Transferor Company (IPCL) and Transferee Company (Reliance Industries Limited) should agree that all questions
arising from the immediate impact of the amalgamation such as position of workers in the Reliance Industries Limited set
up, seniority, promotion, status of Union etc. should be amicably resolved in consultation with the applicants. The issues
are different from the future claims which the employees of IPCL may raise.
14.9 The IPCL workers represented by the applicants must not be denied the benefits which are given to the Reliance Industries
Limited employees or which may be given in future, simply on the ground that they were once employees of IPCL. They
should not be denied the benefits of equal treatment with Reliance Industries Limited employees.
14.10 The first part of Clause 8 regarding the “terms and conditions” should not be understood as keeping them stagnant and
fixed for all time to come. The workers of IPCL should have freedom to demand better terms and conditions or to demand
full integration with the employees of Reliance Industries Limited as per their choice.
14.11 The reservation policy applied by the IPCL before disinvestment and assurance of “best efforts” given by Strategic Partner
Reliance Petrochemicals and/disinvestment will be continued after amalgamation by Reliance Industries Limited.
14.12 The solemn responsibility undertaken by IPCL at Nagothane as regards employment guarantee to the project- affected
persons must continue to be the responsibility of RIL after amalgamation.
14.13 This Court may be pleased to declare that the employees/ workmen of IPCL, Transferor Company, have standing to object
to the scheme before the Court.
14.14 This Court may be pleased to declare and hold that the employees/workmen of Transferor Company (IPCL) and Transferee
Company (Reliance Industries Limited) have a right to participate at all stages of amalgamation as the scheme is not a
unilateral action of IPCL, but is a result of agreement i.e. right to be consulted and involved in the proceedings both by the
Companies and before the Court.
14.15 This Court may be pleased to give directions or suggest necessary modifications in the scheme so as to make it workable
and which are necessary in public interest.
Final Submissions of Mr. Girish Patel: In Sur-rejoinder:
15. Mr. Patel, ld. Advocate, has made further submissions after he received submissions from the Company and made additional
submissions as under:
15.1 It is submitted that the contention of the petitioner regarding the application and effect of Sec. 25FF of the Industrial
Disputes Act, 1947 in the case if IPCL employees is absolutely misconceived in law. The fear of the workers of IPCL have
turned out to be true when the IPCL, the petitioner states that under Sec. 25FF if the employees of the Transferor company
are continued in the Transferee company, they will not be entitled to any retrenchment compensation under Sec. 25FF and
if they refuse to join the transferee company, they will also not be entitled to benefit of retrenchment compensation. This
interpretation of the petitioner company is not correct. If the interpretation sought to be made by the petitioner company
viz., that once the IPCL employees become the employees of Reliance Industries Limited by virtue of the Scheme and the
order of this Court, and if they refuse to join the Reliance Industries Limited, they will not be entitled to any retrenchment
compensation, is correct, it clearly brings out the forcible nature of the transfer of IPCL employees from IPCL to Reliance
Industries Limited. As per the interpretation of the petitioner company, the employees of IPCL will have no option to or not to
join the Reliance Industries Limited because if they refuse to work under the new employer imposed upon them, the refusal
will not be treated as retrenchment and the employees will not be entitled to any retrenchment benefit after long service
with IPCL. It means that the IPCL employees have to join the Reliance Industries Limited under a scheme by the IPCL
in which the workers have no say and by virtue of the order of this Court.
15.2 This contention of the petitioner company shows two important points. One, if this is the effect of the scheme of amalgamation
in the order of the Court, it clearly shows the absolute necessity of consultation by the IPCL with its employees before
taking any decision regarding amalgamation so that all the consequences of the amalgamation can be discussed and
adequate provisions can be made in the scheme for the protection of the interest of the IPCL workers. The employees
could have insisted that the workers must be free to join or not to join the Reliance Industries Limited and if they do not
want to join the new company i.e. Transferee company, they would be given the benefits of retrenchment or they will be
given the benefit of voluntary retirement scheme. This could not happen because the workers of IPCL were completely
excluded from any consultation or dialogue or discussion with the IPCL before amalgamation. Another issue comes out is
that if the interpretation put by the petitioner Company upon Sec. 25FF is correct, the result would be that the workers of
the transferor company will be forced to join the transferee company even if the same terms and conditions of employment
144
remain and if they refuse to join, they will be deprived of the benefits of retrenchment. In other words, the workers have
to accept the scheme on the point of bayonet viz., the loss of retrenchment compensation. In these circumstances, the
employees of IPCL will have no option but to join the Reliance Industries Limited. This forcible transfer of employees from
one company to another will be basically inconsistent with the freedom of the workers to work or not to work under a new
master, as is laid down by the Hon’ble Supreme Court and the High Court in the cases mentioned above. This interpretation
will make Sec. 25FF Industrial Disputes Act, 1947 vulnerable to the constitutional challenge on the ground of violation of
Articles 14, 19(1)(g) and 21 of the Constitution of India.
15.3 It is further submitted that reference made by the petitioner company to the judgment of Hon’ble Supreme Court in the
case of Management, Mettur Beardsell Ltd., vs. Workmen of Mettur Beardsell Limited and another reported in AIR
2006 SC 2056, para 10 has no relevance to the main contention of the applicant Union because the employees have
never intended that for transfer of undertaking or management under Sec. 25FF, consent of the employees is necessary.
The contention of the applicant Union is that the present case is concerned with the scheme of amalgamation under Secs.
391 to 394 of the Companies Act, and as the scheme of amalgamation provides for transfer of employees of IPCL to the
Reliance Industries Limited and the Company has prayed for such an order from the Court, the employees of IPCL ought to
have been taken into confidence by the IPCL when the amalgamation proceedings were going on because unless and until
this is done, the interest of the IPCL employees cannot be properly protected. Moreover, this is also absolutely necessary
before the Company has sought for an order of the Court for sanctioning the scheme and it has been laid down by the
Hon’ble Supreme Court judgments that the Court is concerned also with the public policy and public interest before granting
sanction. It is submitted that even though consent of the workers to the transfer may not be a prerequisite for validity of the
scheme, that does not mean that the workers cannot have any choice and the workers are not entitled to any participation
in the consultation process.
15.4 It is further submitted that requirement of the consent of the workers for a scheme of amalgamation is one thing, while the
requirement of consultation with the workers before the scheme is finalized is another thing. The later requirement flows
from the duty of the Transferor IPCL Company to duly consider and protect the interest of its own employees when they are
transferred to a new Company and also from the duty of the Court to consider whether the scheme is in the public interest
or is opposed to public policy.
15.5 It is further submitted that for this requirement of consultation, what is required to be considered is whether the Companies
Act explicitly prohibits the consultation with the workers. If there is no such explicit prohibition of such requirement, the
provisions of the Companies Act are open to meaningful interpretation when the scheme is before the Court so that the
Court can consider the workers’ interest and workers’ consultation in order to ensure the smooth working of the scheme.
15.6 It is further submitted that para 7 of the reply does not reply the main contention of the IPCL employees regarding immediate
impact of the scheme of amalgamation on the existing rights of the workers. This question is completely distinct from the
question of future demand of the workers after the amalgamation. The question of immediate impact of amalgamation on
the workers’ position is a question to be thrashed out at the very stage of amalgamation and the duty lies upon the transferor
Company by negotiating the scheme with the Transferee company as a guardian of the interest of the workers and the
guardian of public interest and public policy. On the other hand, the question regarding the future demands of employees
of IPCL after amalgamation is a different question and that can be dealt with by the employees after amalgamation by
resorting to appropriate forum.
15.7 It is further submitted that the objection of Clause 8 of the Scheme in fact takes away the rights of the workers to raise
demands after the amalgamation. On the one hand, the scheme automatically makes the workers of IPCL as the workers
of Reliance Industries Limited and also requests the Court to make such an order only on the basis of the scheme, on
the other hand the scheme itself provides that the employees of IPCL will not be eligible for any benefits available to the
employees of Reliance Industries Limited by virtue of amalgamation. This is a clear contradiction.
PUBLIC POLICY AND PUBLIC INTEREST: (By Mr. Girish Patel, ld. sr. counsel)
16.1 One of the most important questions for the Company Court is the question of public policy and public interest. Public policy
and public interest are legal standards and not like fixed specific rules. They are, therefore, flexible and dynamic and they
cannot be put in a strait-jacket formula to be applied economically. The standards of public policy and public interest may
vary depending upon the times and circumstance and the prevailing ideology. Under this formula, the Company Court has
dynamic role to play keeping in mind the facts, circumstances and times and place and ideology.
16.2 There is no specific provision or section in the Companies Act which explicitly and expressly or by necessary implication
excludes workers/ employees from amalgamation proceedings even at the stage of working out the amalgamation scheme.
16.3 The various factors which the Court has to consider while sanctioning the scheme have not been exhaustively laid down
by the Court but they are illustrative and no general formula is laid down. Therefore, each case ultimately depends upon
the facts and circumstances and therefore any one judgement dealing with a specific problem cannot be considered to
be concluding the question for all time to come. The approach of the Court is to evolve the law and the legal standards
gradually.
16.4 The relevant judgements are:
(i) AIR 1997 SC 506 - Miheer Mafatlal (paras 28 onwards and principles laid down - pages 519-529
(ii) (1995) 83 Company Cases 30 - Hindustan Lever Case - page 37 relating to fairness, page 39 (public interest) page

tests to be considered, pages 240-245 (prudent man of business test) page 246 - workers’ interest as part of public
interest.

continuous supervision, directing the appointment of a representative of Textile Association as one Director to
supervise the scheme.
MONOPOLY: (Submission of ld. Advocate Shri Shalin Mehta)
17.1 Creation of monopoly of amalgamation results in creation of monopoly status with Reliance Industries Limited or in concentration
with economic power in the hands of a few individuals. Monopoly status or concentration with economic power in the hands
of a few is opposed to Article 39(b) and (c) of the Constitution of India. Article 39 provides that the State shall, in particular,
direct its policy towards securing - clause (a) xxxx, clause (b) that the ownership and control of the material resources of the
community are so distributed as best to subserve the common good; clause (c) that the operation of the economic system
does not result in the concentration of weal and means of production to the common detriment. The Directive Principles
of State Policy, though not enforceable in Courts of law, are in the governance of the Country and as held by the Hon’ble
Supreme Court of India in several cases, a proper balance is required to be struck between the fundamental rights and the
Directive Principles of State Policy while construing a statute or any action. Therefore, in the present case, the relevant
provisions of the Companies Act, 1956 (Sections 391 and 394) are required to be read and interpreted in conjunction with
Article 39 of the Constitution of India.
17.2 A scheme of amalgamation cannot be de hors public interest and public policy. Acquisition of monopoly status or a
controlling market share in the industry is a very important element of public interest and public policy. The Company
Court exercising equitable jurisdiction in amalgamation proceedings, is the guardian or custodian of public interest and
public policy. Therefore, the aspect of public interest and public policy is required to be gone into by the Company Court
in amalgamation proceedings when a scheme of amalgamation comes up for sanction. Obviously, public interest scrutiny
cannot be left to the petitioner Company or to the rent seekers of capital.
17.3 Hindustan Lever Employees’ Case (1995 Suppl. (1) SCC 499) deals with the public interest element involved in a
scheme of amalgamation or merger. Thus, as stated by the Hon’ble Supreme Court, creation of monopoly status and the
resultant entity - competitive behaviour may be a ground to reject a proposed scheme of amalgamation.
17.4 This public interest and public policy element has not been gone into at all by the Union of India or the Registrar of
Companies or the Official Liquidator. Neither the report of the Official Liquidator nor the report of the Registrar of Companies
reflects that the acquisition of monopoly status or merger or amalgamation was a serious concern to be addressed.
17.5 The Department of Justice guidelines applicable to mergers and acquisitions taking place within the jurisdiction of the
United States of America show the concern of the Government to merger resulting in acquisition of monopoly status or anticompetitive behaviour. The Federal Trade Commission (an agency established to examine in anti-competitive behaviour
of firms) and most jurisdictions in the United States apply what is known as a “per se” rule to mergers and acquisitions
resulting in monopoly status. If a merger or acquisition is found to result in creation of market power or market share
exceeding 50%, the merger or acquisition is not allowed. The Department of Justice guidelines only reflect the concern with
which big mergers are viewed. These concerns cannot be said to be alien to amalgamations and mergers taking place in
India where some of them would result in creation of a monopoly or in anti-competitive behaviour.
HIDDEN OBJECT:
18.1 There is a hidden object between the proposed scheme of amalgamation. This hidden object is so hideous that the
proposed scheme of amalgamation is required to be trashed.
18.2 As held by the Hon’ble Supreme Court in Miheer Mafatlal’s case, “for ascertaining the real purpose underlying the scheme
with a view to satisfy on this aspect, the Court, if necessary, can pierce the veil of apparent corporate purpose underlying
the scheme and can judiciously X-ray the same”.
18.3 The real and apparent purpose of the present scheme of amalgamation is that Reliance Industries Limited wants to strip
IPCL of its assets for diverting funds to the Special Economic Zones to steal the Crown Jewels of IPCL for its own risky
business ventures. Reliance Industries Limited wants to wipe out the reserves of IPCL worth Rs. 4500 crores in one stroke.
Reliance Industries Limited wants to undertake a systematic liquidation of IPCL assets to fund its ventures. The Company
Court ought not to approve of a scheme that has its object a systematic liquidation of the transferor company’s assets. In
this context, the observations made by Hon’ble Supreme Court in para 28 of Miheer Mafatlal’s case are apposite.
18.4 In the past, IPCL was considering to be a “Navratna”. IPCL was classified as a “strategic sector” industry. The “strategic
sector” was considered to be so important to India that private ventures were not allowed entry. Under the proposed scheme
of amalgamation, Reliance Industries Limited will come to acquire a “strategic sector” industry without any reciprocating
social responsibility. Can it be of any public interest to rip off a company and dismantle it without having regard to the
various economic and social factors concerning the society. In this context, the Hindustan Lever Employees’ decision of
Hon’ble Supreme Court makes an observation that “it is not the interest of the shareholders or the employees only but the
interest of the society which may have to be examined. And a scheme valid and good may yet be bad if it is against public
interest.”
18.5 The burden to prove that the proposed scheme of amalgamation is in the public interest or is not opposed to public interest
and public policy lies on the petitioner Company who comes before the Company Court for sanction. Thus burden cannot be
shifted upon the objectors by called upon them to show that the proposed scheme of amalgamation is not in public interest.
One of the elemental principles of the law of evidence is that the burden to prove a fact would lie on the party ascertaining it.
Under Sections 391 to 392 of the Companies Act, the petitioner Company can get sanction of a Scheme of amalgamation
from the Company Court only if the scheme is not against public interest and public policy. This means that a heavy burden
lies on the petitioner Company to prove affirmatively that the scheme proposed is not opposed to public interest and
public policy. There is complete lack of pleadings on this aspect by the petitioner Company. The pleadings of the Company
Petition do not show how the proposed scheme of amalgamation is not opposed to public interest and public policy or
that the scheme is in public interest. By merely stating in the pleadings that the proposed scheme is not opposed to public
interest and public policy cannot satisfy the stringent test of public interest and public policy in amalgamation proceedings.
The petitioner Company would have to show to the Court that several economic and social factors affecting society have
been taken into account while proposing the scheme of amalgamation. This is totally absent in the present case.
146
PIERCE THE VEIL:
19. Reasons why the Company Court in the present case, pierce the veil of apparent corporate purpose and judiciously X-ray the
present proposed scheme of amalgamation.
19.1 At no stage of the proposed scheme of amalgamation, the workers and employees of IPCL or the registered trade unions
of IPCL have been consulted.
19.2 Even the most basic document asked for by the objectors was denied by the petitioner Company. The share valuation
report which forms the basis of the scheme was denied to the objectors thought they specifically asked for a copy of the
same. Thus, there has been a complete lack of transparency and openness in the proceedings leading up to the present
Company Petition.
19.3 IPCL is an associate Company of Reliance Industries Limited since the year 2002. Reliance Industries Limited holds
controlling shares in IPCL. The share holding pattern of IPCL is such that Reliance Industries Limited can write rough shod
over the dissenting voice in IPCL. This ought to create enough suspicion in the minds of the Court so as to heighten the
level of scrutiny while examining the proposed scheme of amalgamation.
19.4 The share exchange ratio worked out by the experts suffers from gross and material irregularities. The valuation report
submitted to the Company Court does not disclose or divulge any facts and figures in support of the conclusion arrive at
by the experts that a fair share exchange ratio would be one fully paid up equity share of Reliance Industries Limited in
exchange of five fully paid up equity share of IPCL.
19.5 The amalgamation or merger would result in creation of monopoly power with Reliance Industries Limited. Acquisition of
monopoly power and the resultant anticompetitive behaviour are opposed to public interest and public policy.
19.6 The proposed scheme of amalgamation completely ignores the interest of the society at large. The proposed scheme does
not guarantee creation of more jobs or more competition or availability of products to the consumers at cheaper prices.
19.7 The conduct of the petitioner Company bars it from claiming any relief in the Company Petition. Before the equity
shareholders’ meeting on 14.4.2007, certain minority equity shareholders were threatened to sign blank proxy forms in the
petitioner Company. This antecedent conduct of the petitioner Company is a relevant factor to be taken into account by the
Company Court at the time of sanction.
19.8 The proposed scheme contains self-contradictory clauses. One of the prayers in the Company Petition is that an order be
passed under Section 394 of the Companies Act, 1956, that all permanent employees of the petitioner Company as on
the effective date shall become the employees of the Transferee Company (Reliance Industries Limited) in accordance
with the provisions set out in the scheme. Diametrically opposed to this, Clause 8.1 of the scheme of amalgamation
provides that “it is clarified that the employees of the transferor Company (IPCL) who become employees of the transferee
Company (Reliance Industries Limited) by virtue of this scheme, shall not be entitled to the employment policies and shall
not be entitled to avail of any schemes and benefits that may be applicable and available to any of the employees of the
Transferee Company (including the benefits of or under Employee Stock Option Scheme applicable to or covering all or
any of the employees of the transferee Company) unless otherwise determined by the Transferee Company.” Thus on the
one hand the petitioner Company seeks an order that the employees of IPCL would become the employees of Reliance
Industries Limited with effect from 1.4.2006. But on the other hand, the scheme says that the employees of IPCL would
not really become the employees of Reliance Industries Limited. This makes the scheme obnoxious, wholly unfair, ex facie
unreasonable and patently unjust. The scheme would block the future of the employees of IPCL for an indefinite period.
SHARE EXCHANGE RATIO/SWAP RATIO OF 1:5:
20. Share exchange ratio/swap ratio of 1:5 (one share of Reliance Industries Limited in exchange of 5 shares of IPCL) is unfair, unjust
and prejudicial to the whole class of equity shareholders of IPCL.
20.1 The following are the infirmities and irregularities with regard to the share exchange ratio.
20.2 Those specifically asked for and demanded at the meeting of the equity shareholders of IPCL held on 14.4.2007, the share
valuation report prepared by M/s. Pricewaterhouse Coopers Pvt. Ltd. And Ernst & Young Pvt. Ltd., to arrive at the share
exchange ratio was not supplied to the applicants of the Company Application No. 259 of 2007. Thus, the objectors have
been denied a fair opportunity to comment on the report.
20.3 As the share valuation report was kept open for inspection on the day of the meeting of equity shareholders of IPCL, a mere
inspection of the report would not have amounted to a fair opportunity to comment on the report. The Hon’ble Supreme
Court held that share valuation is a technical and complex matter. Laymen like the minority shareholders of IPCL cannot be
expected to comment on the spur of the moment on a matter of such expertise and technicality. The petitioner Company
would not have suffered any prejudice if one copy of the share valuation report was supplied to the objectors. However, the
objectors have suffered a severe prejudice by not being able to comment or even peruse the share valuation report.
20.4 While determining the fairness, justness and wisdom of the share exchange ratio, the Company Court has to see whether
the proper accounting principles are followed, the proper methodology is adopted and relevant factors are taken into
account and irrelevant factors are eschewed. This would not mean that the Company Court is not to undertake any
inquiry after finding that the share exchange ratio is recommended by experts. In fact, in the case of HINDUSTAN LEVER
EMPLOYEES’ case reported in 1995 Suppl. (1) SCC 499, the Hon’ble Supreme Court has referred to various factors that
may have to be taken into account in determining the final share exchange ratio.
20.5 The learned advocate has submitted that this view is again reiterated in MIHEER MAFATLAL’S CASE (1997) 1 SCC 579
at page 620. Thus, the Court’s supervisory role in amalgamation proceedings will not prevent it from making an inquiry as
to whether all relevant factors were taken into account by the experts while arriving the share exchange ratio.
20.6 Several important factors highlighted by the applicants in Company Application No. 259 of 2007 have not been taken into
account by the experts while arriving at the share exchange ratio. Some of these factors are:
147
20.7 Fresh valuation of IPCL’s assets has not been undertaken since disinvestment in the year 2002. On the other hand the
assets of Reliance Industries Limited have been valued on as many as four occasions before the proposal of the present
scheme of amalgamation. Thus IPCL has been severely undervalued.
20.8 The cash reserve ratio of IPCL is more available than the cash reserve ratio of Reliance Industries Limited.
20.9 The price earning ratio of Reliance Industries Limited is 19 whereas the price earning ratio of IPCL is 6. Thus IPCL is 3
times stronger than Reliance Industries Limited. IPCL has that much more earning capacity.
20.10 IPCL is an associate company of Reliance Industries Limited since the year 2002. The share holding pattern of IPCL
would show that Reliance Industries Limited holds controlling shares in IPCL. On account of this, a heavy burden lies on
the petitioner Company to show that there had been arms-length dealing with IPCL and Reliance Industries Limited before
adopting the share exchange ratio.
20.11 A look at the share valuation report also shows that no facts and figures concerning the two companies (Reliance Industries
Limited and IPCL) are referred to. Without making any reference to the facts and figures concerning the two companies,
the experts have recommended a share exchange ratio of one fully paid up equity share of Reliance Industries Limited
of Rs. 10/- face value for five fully paid up equity shares of IPCL of Rs. 10/- face value without mentioning any facts and
figures. It is not unknown that valuation involves statistics, mathematics, and economic models. There is no mathematics
or statistics or econometrics preferred in the share valuation report. The conclusion of the experts can be separated only by
relying upon facts and figures of the two companies. As the facts and figures of the two companies are totally absent in the
share valuation report, it is not even possible for the objectors to comment on the report. The share valuation report must at
least show that the relevant factors of the two companies are taken into account for determining the share exchange ratio.
Otherwise, the share valuation report becomes a mere ipse dixit of the experts.
20.12 It is submitted that page 5 of the share valuation report states that the market value of IPCL has been computed by
averaging the value and volume of shares traded for the last three months. Similarly the report also mentions that market
value of Reliance Industries Limited has been computed by averaging the value and volume traded for the last three
months. Clearly, this period of three months is too short to decide fairly the market value of the respective companies.
In MIHEER MAFATLAL’s case (supra), the Chartered Accountants M/s. C.C. Choksi & Company had taken into account
the market price of equity shares of past 24 months (page 619 para 40). In the present case, the petitioner is seeking
sanction for the proposed scheme of amalgamation with effect from 1.4.2006. When the petitioner Company is seeking
sanction with effect from 1.4.2006, common sense requires that the market value of the respective Companies ought to
be computed by averaging the value and the volume of shares traded for the last 12 months before 1.4.2006. Instead, in
the present case, the period from December 2006 to February, 2007 has been taken into account by the experts to work
out the market value of the respective Companies. This is patently unfair, ex facie arbitrary and manifestly illegal. Real
market value of the respective Companies could not have been arrived at by merely averaging the value and the volume of
shares traded for the period from December 2006 to February, 2007, because by then the whole market had known about
the proposed scheme of amalgamation between the two Companies. Obviously, speculative element could not have been
avoided in ascertaining the market value of the respective Companies because as soon as news of the proposed scheme
of amalgamation entered the market, the trading in the shares of the respective Companies would have increased. To
arrive at the real market value of the respective Companies, the period of 12 months prior to 1.4.2006 ought to have been
taken into account by the experts. As this has not been done in the present case, it can be easily assumed that the share
exchange ratio suffers from speculation.
20.13 In the absence of detailed valuation report, there is a presumption against the petitioner Company of bad faith and ulterior
motive. Burden to prove that the Scheme is fair, reasonable and not against public policy / interest is on the petitioner
Company, in the absence of which the Company Court can strike down the Scheme under its supervisory jurisdiction.
20.14 In support of the above objections, the objectors have relied upon :
(i) In Re. Torrent Power AEC Ltd. (2007) 38 Comp. Cases 139 (at pages 160-161)
(ii) G.L. Sultania Vs. SEBI (2007) 5 SCC 133.
ADDITIONAL SUBMISSIONS MADE BY MR. SHALIN MEHTA, LD. ADVOCATE (RE: SHARE EXCHANGE RATIO) - IN
REJOINDER:
20.15 The following are the additional infirmities and irregularities with regard to the share exchange ratio:
20.16 Though it was submitted at the time of oral arguments on behalf of the petitioner Company that the share valuation report is
attached with the Official Liquidator’s report in the present proceedings, the said report is not the share valuation report at
all. The letter dated 9.3.2007 that is annexed with the Official Liquidator’s report cannot be called a share valuation report.
It is at the most a letter/ certificate issued by the experts conveying that they have recommended a share exchange ratio
of one fully paid equity share of Reliance Industries Limited in exchange of five fully paid up equity shares of IPCL. What
was kept open for inspection by the petitioner Company at the meeting of the equity shareholders held on 14.4.2007 was
not the share valuation report but this letter/certificate dated 9.3.2007 issued by the experts.
20.17 By not disclosing the share valuation report at the meeting of the equity shareholders of IPCL held on 14.4.2007, though a
demand was raised by the objectors, the petitioner Company has not made a true, full and fair disclosure as required under
the proviso to Section 391(2) of the Companies Act, 1956. In any scheme of amalgamation, the share exchange ratio is
the most basic and fundamental document. Share exchange ratio can be arrived at only from the share valuation report.
Therefore, when a specific objection is raised to the share exchange ratio, it is imperative on the part of the petitioner Company
to disclose the valuation of the shares by producing the share valuation report at the meeting of the equity shareholders
that is convened and proposed to consider the scheme of amalgamation. Even MIHEER MAFATLAL’s case (supra) holds
that any scheme of amalgamation is bound to fail unless a true, proper and fair disclosure is made as contemplated under
proviso to Section 391(2) of the Companies Act, 1956. In the present case, as the share valuation report was not kept
open for inspection by the petitioner Company, was not disclosed at the meeting of the equity shareholders of the petitioner
Company held on 14.4.2007, and was not supplied to the objectors though a specific demand in this regard was raised by
them at the equity shareholders’ meeting by objecting to the share exchange ratio, the present scheme of amalgamation is
violative of the proviso to Section 391(2) of the Companies Act, 1956.
148
20.18 The document dated 9.3.2007 that is attached with the Official Liquidator’s report in the present proceedings is not the
share valuation report on account of the following:
(a) No figures/ date in support of the valuation arrived at are mentioned from the document.
(b) The document reveals that the three accounting methods stated to have been used by the experts have given out
three different valuations. However, the analysis under each accounting method is not stated in the document.
(c) The document does not mention the factors that the experts have taken into account while arriving at the share
exchange ratio. The factors that would normally go into determination of the share exchange ratio are enumerated in
HINDUSTAN LEVER EMPLOYEES’s case reported in (1995) Suppl. (1) SCC 499.
(d) The document reveals that the experts have used all the three accounting methods for the purpose of valuation
of shares. However, the experts have recommended that higher weightage is required to be given to the value
determined under the “income” approach and “market” approach compared to the value determined under the
‘underlying assets’ approach. But the document does not reveal how much higher weightage was given to the first
two methods compared to the third method.
20.19 The jurisdiction of the Company Court with regard to the share exchange ratio is supervisory. Under this supervisory
jurisdiction, the Company Court can do the following.
(a) The Court can see whether the experts have taken into account the relevant factors.
(b) The Court can see that the experts have applied the correct accounting principles.
(c) The Court can see that no one factor is given undue emphasize or preference at the expense of other factors.
(d) The Court can see that the decision of the experts is not irrational or ex facie unreasonable.
(e) The Court can see that proper procedure is followed by the experts while arriving at the share exchange ratio.
(f) The Court can see whether the valuation of the shares done by the experts broadly reflects the worth of the
Company.
20.20 This can be achieved only when the share valuation report is placed on record of the amalgamation proceedings for the
Company Court’s perusal. There is not a single decision either of the Hon’ble Supreme Court or of any High Court that
share valuation report in an amalgamation proceeding need not be given to the Company Court or to the objectors who
have raised a challenge to the share exchange ratio.
WHOSE BURDEN:
20.21 The burden to prove that the Scheme of amalgamation is fair, just, reasonable, not unconscionable, not against public
interest, not against public policy and not illegal is on the petitioner Company. The scheme is proposed by the petitioner
Company. Therefore, it cannot be the burden of the objectors to show otherwise.
20.22 Very recent amalgamation of 6 sick units, viz. Apollo Fibers Limited, Central India Polyesters Limited, India Polyfibers
Limited, Orissa Polyfibers Limited, Recron Synthetics Limited and Silvassa Industries Private Limited into IPCL in the year
2006 has resulted in a reduction of IPCL’s profit at least on paper. This aspect ought to have been factored in by the experts
while determining the share exchange ratio.
PROXIES:
21. Serious irregularities were committed by the petitioner Company in obtaining proxies from certain minority equity shareholders of
IPCL. Certain minorities equity shareholders of IPCL were threatened or coerced into signing blank proxy forms by the Heads of
Departments of IPCL before the day of the equity shareholders’ meeting. First, the registered trade Unions of IPCL complained
about this to the Chairman of IPCL by writing a letter on 10.4.2007. Second, the said complaint was lodged with the Chairman of the
equity shareholders’ meeting on 14.4.2007. On 17.4.2007, a complaint regarding this was also made to the Chairman to Securities
Exchange Board of India.
21.1 The Chairman’s report only mentions that all persons who had given proxy earlier would be allowed to vote if they remained
present at the meeting and their proxy given earlier would be treated as cancelled. However, the Chairman’s report does
not deal with the aspect of the petitioner Company threatening and coercing certain equity shareholders to sign blank
proxy forms. Clearly, the petitioner Company was guilty of irresponsible behaviour. The petitioner Company was guilty of
overreaching the process of law. Such bad faith-action taken by the petitioner Company against certain equity shareholders
of IPCL would be:
21.2 Violative of Section 166 which provides for holding of Annual General Meeting under the Companies Act, 1956
21.3 Violative of the Articles of Association of IPCL where the manner and method of giving proxy is laid down.
21.4 Violative of the High Court’s order dated 23.4.2007 passed in Company Petition No. 93 of 2007 in Company Application No.
126 of 2007. In this order, the Court had ordered that voting by proxy is permitted provided that the proxy in the prescribed
form and duly signed by the person entitled to attend and vote at the aforesaid meeting, or by his authorized representative.
Obviously, therefore if the proxy is obtained in an illegal manner, the same would fall foul of the High Court’s order dated
23.4.2007.
SUBMISSIONS: (Re: Joint Meeting of Secured Creditors wi vcth Debenture holders)
22. Meeting between debenture holders and secured creditors to be held separately and they are to be treated as debenture holders
are separate class by itself:
22.1 The debenture holders of IPCL formed a class distinct and separate from the secured creditors of IPCL. So the debenture
holders could not have been clubbed with the secured creditors. A separate meeting of the debenture holders was required
to be called by the petitioner Company.
149
22.2 Following are the reasons why the debenture holders of IPCL are required to be treated as a class by themselves and
separate and distinct from the secured creditors of IPCL.
22.3 Commercial law and Common law recognize three broad categories / classes of creditors, viz. Preferential creditors,
secured creditors and unsecured creditors. [Palmers Company Law, 21st Edition, page 700: (1970) 40 Company Cases
819 (at page 877) Gujarat; in re Maneckchowk and Ahmedabad Manufacturing Company Limited.
22.4 The debenture holders of IPCL belong to the category / class of preferential creditors. In the event of liquidation of the
petitioner Company, the debenture holders would get paid off first in preference to the secured and unsecured creditors of
IPCL.
22.5 The Companies Act, 1956, has special provisions for protecting the interest of debenture holders. In this connection the
learned advocate has referred to Section 117A which provides Debenture Trust, Section 117B provides appointment of
Debenture Trustee and duties of Debenture Trustees. Section 117C of the Companies Act provides liability of Company to
create security and Debenture Redemption Reserve. These Sections have been added subsequently vide the Companies
(Amendment) Act, 2000, with effect from 13.12.2000. Thus the intention of the Companies Act is to provide special
protection to the class of debenture holders. The Companies Act recognizes the special and unique status enjoyed by
the debenture holders. These special provisions are not to apply to the secured and unsecured creditors of the Company.
Thus, the Companies Act itself discriminates between the debenture holders and the secured creditors.
22.6 The Articles of Association of IPCL also provides separately for debentures and debenture holder (pages 45 to 47 of the
Articles of Association of IPCL). There is no reference in these provisions to the secured creditors of IPCL. Thus, the
Articles of Association of IPCL also confers a distinct status on the debenture holders.
22.7 The balance-sheet of IPCL as on 31.3.2006 also provides separate treatment to debentures and debenture holders. The
debentures are not clubbed with other secured term loans and working capital loans.
22.8 The debenture holders of IPCL and the secured creditors of IPCL have dissimilar charges over the Company’s assets.
Whereas the non-convertible debentures are secured by way of first equitable mortgage on all those pieces and parcel of
land admeasuring 2.04 acres situated at village Angadh, Dist. Vadodara in the State of Gujarat together with all structures
thereon and on all plant, machinery and equipments both present and future attached thereto, located at the Vadodara
Complex of the Company and the balance debentures by the mortgagees and charges over the properties acquired by the
Company pursuant to the scheme, the term loans are secured on land admeasuring one acre situated at village Angadh,
Dist. Vadodara in the State of Gujarat together with all the structures thereon and all plant, machinery and equipments
both present and future attached thereto, and the whole of the other fixed assets of Vadodara and Gandhar complexes
of the Company except all the pieces and parcels of land of the said complexes and working capital loans from Banks
by hypothecation of stocks of raw material, stock-in-process, finished goods, stores, receivables and goods in transit of
Vadodara, Gandhar, Nagothane, Allahabad and Silvassa units. Thus, the rights and interest and charges of debenture
holders are dissimilar to the rights, interest and charges of the secured creditors. On account of such dissimilarity, the
debenture holders cannot be clubbed with the secured creditors.
22.9 The Chairman’s report at page 115 of the Company petition on the meeting of the secured creditors held on 14.4.2007
does not at all reflect the voting pattern between the debenture holders of IPCL and the secured creditors of IPCL. Out of
51 secured creditors (including debenture holders) alleged to have remained present at the meeting, the Chairman’s report
does not spell out how many of them were debenture holders and how many of them were secured creditors. In response
to this specific objection on this aspect taken by the applicants of the Company Application No. 259 of 2007, the petitioner
Company has not stated in its pleadings as to how many debenture holders were present at the meeting of the secured
creditors held on 14.4.2007. If the Chairman’s report does not reflect the voting pattern between debenture holders and
secured creditors who are two distinct and separate classes, the proposed scheme of amalgamation cannot be sanctioned.
The learned advocate has relied on the decision in the case of Maneckchowk and Ahmedabad Manufacturing Company
Limited reported in (1970) 40 Company Cases 819 particularly pages 873 to 878.
22.10 The learned advocate for the applicants of Company Application No. 259 of 2007 in Company Petition No. 93 of 2007 has
relied on the following decisions in support of the proposition that the debenture holders of IPCL form a class distinct and
separate from the secured creditors of IPCL:
22.11 1995 Suppl. (1) SCC 499 at pages 514-528 - Hindustan Lever Employees’ Union Vs. Hindustan Lever Limited and others.
22.12 (1970) 40 Company Cases 819 at page 877 (Gujarat) in re. Maneckchowk and Ahmedabad Manufacturing Company
Limited.
22.13 (1994) 79 Company Cases 27, at pages 37 to 40 D.A. Swamy and others Vs. India Meter Limited (Madras).
PETITIONER COMPANY’S SUBMISSIONS ON EACH POINT OF OBJECTIONS
RAISED BY THE OBJECTORS:
(A) RE: ANCILLARY INDUSTRIES:
23.1 The Objectors are neither shareholders nor creditors of the Petitioner Company and have, therefore, no locus in the present
proceedings.
23.2 Letter of Intent (LOI) is NOT a concluded contract. In terms of LOI, IPCL was to obtain supplies from the Units subject to
the Units meeting price and quality specifications as set out in the LOI.
23.3 IPCL, in terms of LOI, was to obtain 50% of the Unit’s production and, therefore, the existence of the Units was not
fully dependent on IPCL taking the supplies. IPCL obtained supplies from the Units for many years before it stopped
placing orders from August, 2003 onwards, as the Units were not able to match the price and quality specifications. Before
stoppage of orders, IPCL held discussions with the Raigad District Plastics Producers Association comprising these Units.
In any event, IPCL took supplies from the Units in their ‘development phase for a reasonable period of time’ as mentioned
in the LOI.
150
23.4 Even if the said LOI was a contract, the disputes will be with respect to implementation of the alleged contract between the
parties and obligations of IPCL, if any, would be assumed by the Transferee Company post amalgamation. This Court, as
a Company Court, is not the forum to entertain these matters and the Objectors may approach an appropriate forum, if they
so wish.
23.5 One of the Objectors, viz. Schon Plastics Private Ltd. (‘Schon’), had filed a petition in the Bombay High Court seeking
directions against IPCL inter alia to comply with the contract. The Bombay High Court while dismissing the petition,
observed that the dispute raised therein was contractual in nature and the remedy lies only in the appropriate form or
by way of arbitration. Accordingly, the suit being Suit No. 32 of 2006 has been filed by Schon in Alibagh Court, which is
pending.
23.6 In terms of Clause 6 of the Scheme, upon amalgamation becoming effective, all the suits and legal proceedings pending
by or against IPCL would be continued by or against the Transferee Company. It is not even their case that the Transferee
Company would be unable to honour their claims.
23.7 As alleged by the Units, 500 workers were employed by the Units. However, the Units have not produced any proof
evidencing the so-called PAP employment. Further, this has never been prayed earlier either in the objections filed with
this Court or in the civil suit. Moreover, the so called PAP have never objected nor approached the Petitioner Company
with their grievances. As a matter of fact, IPCL itself employed more than 600 PAP at its Nagothane Plant. Hence, the
responsibility/ liability of the workers employed by the Units themselves will always be on the Units and the same has
nothing to do with the present Scheme.
23.8 Upon amalgamation become effective, in terms of Clause 6 of the Scheme, any proceedings pending by or against the
Transferor Company shall be continued by or against the Transferee Company. Question therefore of the Objectors of
losing the alleged territorial jurisdiction of their suit to be entertained at the District Court, Baroda, on the ground of Scheme
being sanctioned does not arise.
(B) RE. SC/ST RESERVATION:
24.1 At the outset, since the representation made by the Objector pursuant to this Court’s order dated May 8, 2007, to the Central
Government and the said representation is pending for consideration, the Objector cannot agitate the same matter again before
this Court.
24.2 Further, the final outcome of the appropriate/ final appellate forum, if any, would, in any event, be binding on IPCL and post
amalgamation, the Transferee Company.
24.3 Without prejudice to the above, IPCL had never agreed to incorporate any such clause of reservation of SC/ST employees
in the Scheme nor, as a matter of fact, any such provision has been made in the Shareholders Agreement, as alleged by
the Objector.
(C) RE: WORKERS
25.1 Clause 8.1 of the Scheme protects employees’ rights in as much as it has fully safeguarded the interest of the employees
of the Petitioner Company by providing that the terms and conditions of employment in the Transferee Company will
be without any break or interruption and the terms and conditions as to employment and remuneration shall not be less
favourable than those on which they are engaged or employed by the Petitioner Company. Further, the Transferee
Company undertakes to continue to abide by any agreement/settlement, if any, entered into by the Transferor Company
with any union/ employee of the Transferor Company.
25.2 The learned counsel has relied on the judgement in the case of Hindustan Lever Employees’ Union vs. Hindustan
Levers Ltd., and others (1995) 83 Comp. Case 1 (Bom) : (1994) 4 Comp. LJ 228 (Bom), where the Court has observed
as under:
“Whenever an undertaking is transferred whether statutorily or by court’s order to another employer, it is the usual formula
to protect the workers of the transferred company by providing that the service will be continuous and uninterrupted
and service conditions will not be prejudicially affected by reasons or transfer. Merger of two companies into one may
necessitate adjustments in service conditions in certain areas, but that is a matter for industrial adjudication by appropriate
forum. The interest of employees of both companies being adequately taken care of, held, there was no necessity of any
change in the scheme of amalgamation”.
25.3 There is no requirement of holding any separate meeting or discussion by the Petitioner Company with workmen/workmen’s
association.
25.4 The learned counsel for the petitioner relies on the decision in the case of Hindustan Lever Employees’ Union vs. Hindustan
Levers Ltd., and others, (1995) 83 Comp. Cases 30 : (1994) 2 SCL 157 : (1994) 4 Comp. LJ 228, Supp.1 SCC 499 (SC),
page 38, para G and page 65 para C, “A scheme of amalgamation cannot be faulted on apprehension and speculation as
to what might possibly happen in future. The present is certain and taken care of. No one can envisage what will happen in
the long run. But on this hypothetical question, the scheme cannot be rejected. As of now, it has not been shown how the
workers are prejudiced by the scheme”.
25.5 On one side, the Objectors are seeking job security and on other side they are alleging forceful continuance out of
economic and legal compulsion. The objections are baseless. Workmen can continue with the Transferee Company post
amalgamation with their existing rights protected under the Scheme.
25.6 The rights of employees are well protected under the Scheme. Further, all service conditions in respect of workmen shall
be guided by the applicable law in future.
25.7 The Petitioner Company relies upon the following authorities in support of the above submissions -
(a) Gujarat Nylons Ltd. Vs. Gujarat State Fertilizers Ltd., 1992(1) GLH 637, para 36. (C.K.Thakker, J.) (as he was then)
(b) Re: Hindustan Lever Ltd (1995) 83 Comp. Cases 39, page 64, para D onwards to page 65 para C.
151
(c) In Re: Narmada Chematur Petrochemicals Ltd., (Re: Company Petition No. 147 of 2006 & other matters, Unreported
judgment dated 9.1.2007, delivered by Hon’ble Mr.Justice M.R.Shah, page 23, para 27 and 28.
(d) In Re: Blue Star Ltd., (2001) 104 Comp. Cases 371, page 381, 389 and 395.
Additional submission on behalf of the Company regarding workers:
25.8 Dealing with the grievances as summarized in para 9 of the written submissions, it has been clarified in the course
of submission that there is no compulsion under the Scheme on the workers to join the new employment. It has
been pointed out that relief in para 28(3) of the petition is intended to ensure that there is a continuity of service.
Existing employees have an option not to join the service of the Transferee Company and leave the service.
Therefore, the provision that if the relief as prayed for in para 28(e) is granted, the existing workforce will forcibly
have to join the service of the transferee company is misplaced. A similar provision in the Scheme has been
considered by this Court in the matter of Gujarat Nylon Limited reported in 1992(1) GLH 637 (particularly para 24) and in
the matter of Narmada Chematur Petrochemicals Ltd., unreported judgement dated 9.1.2007, Company Petition No. 147
of 2006 (particularly paragraph No. 27 of the unreported judgement). Similarly worded relief has been construed that there
is no compulsion on the employees to join the transferee company that the provision has been made to ensure continuity of
service and it is open to the workmen not to join the service of the transferee Company [Ref: (a) 1992(1) GLH 637 in the matter
of Gujarat Nylons Limited, paragraph Nos. 24, 25, 29, 30 and 36; (b) unreported judgement dated 9.1.2007 in the matter of
Narmade Chematur Petrochemicals Ltd., paras 27 and 28; [c] Hindustan Lever Limited reported in 1995 (83) Company
Cases page 30 para B to G, pg. 64, para D onwards to page 65 para-C]
25.9 Regarding the grievance that they were not consulted in the process of negotiations and their consent was not taken
to the Scheme of Amalgamation, reference may be made to the decision of the Hon’ble Supreme Court in the case of
MANAGEMENT, METTUR BEARDSELL LTD. VS. WORKMEN OF METTUR BEARDSELL LTD. & ANR. Reported AIR
2006 SC 2056.
25.10 Consent of workers of the transferor Company to the Scheme of merger therefore is not necessary.
25.11 Section 25FF of the Industrial Disputes Act provides for rights of the workers of the Transferor company. Their consent to
the transfer is not necessary. They have even no right to demand their absorption in the transferee company. If the new
employer is not prepared to protect the existing service conditions and continuity of service, only right of the employees
of the transferor company is as specified in Section 25FF(1) of the Industrial Disputes Act. Indisputably, in Clause 8 of the
Scheme, a provision has been made for protection of the service conditions and continuity of service, and therefore, there
is no “deemed retrenchment” of the workmen. Section 25FF of the Industrial Disputes Act, which provides for transfer of
ownership or management of an undertaking does not provide that even in case where transferee employer protects the
service conditions and continuity of service and a workman still desires not to join the service of the transferee employer,
such workmen should be entitled to anything more than what an employee gets on voluntary relinquishment of his service.
25.12 It is also held that Sections 391 to 394 Companies Act is a complete code. These provisions do not provide for consultation
with the workers in case of merger or amalgamation. Meetings only of the members of the company and creditors have
been provided. No statutory provision or legal principle have been pointed out by the union which make it a condition
of a valid scheme that in the course of negotiation, the workers should have been consulted or failure on the part of the
management to consult the workers before formulating the Scheme of merger would invalidate the Scheme.
25.13 It needs to be noted that no statutory provisions is cited by the Unions nor any binding precedent referred to in support
of this contention that either the workers should have been consulted at the time of preparation of the Scheme or during
negotiations or when a decision to merge IPCL with RIL was taken. In absence of such provision, it cannot be said that the
Scheme is against law.
25.14 The Hon’ble Supreme Court has in the case of Hindustan Lever Limited vs. State of Maharashtra reported in (2004) 9 SCC
438 observed, particularly, paragraph Nos. 10 and 11.
25.15 The objections that the workers have the right to be heard at the time of the hearing of the petition need not be considered,
since they have been already heard and no objection has been taken to the locus of workmen to object to the Scheme.
25.16 So far as the rights of the workers subsequent to amalgamation is concerned, it is well settled that it always open to the
workers to be employees of the transferee company, to raise such demand, to claim such benefit and raise such disputes
as may be permissible under the Industrial Law.
25.17 Clause 8 of the Scheme does not foreclose this right of the workmen in any manner. What Clause 8 of the Scheme provides
is that “by virtue” of the Scheme, the employees of the Transferor company shall not be entitled to the employment policies
or any schemes or benefits that may be applicable and available to the employees of the Transferee Company. This does
not obviously take away the rights of the employees on becoming the employees of the Transferee company to raise such
demands or disputes or claim benefits on whatever ground that may be permissible under the law, as the employees of the
Transferee Company. Such demands if raised, would be adjudicated by the authorities under the Industrial Law subject to
the contentions of the transferee company. The present scheme does not and cannot take away the statutory rights of the
workmen under the Industrial Law.
25.18 Employees’ right to seniority and promotion as of existing employees of the Transferee company constitute to the extent
that they are part of the existing conditions of service, which are protected by Clause 8 of the Scheme and post-merger
would be governed by the provisions of the Industrial Disputes Act and in particular Section 9(a) of the Industrial Disputes
Act. The Company also relied upon the judgement of the S.C. In Mettur Beardsell Vs. its Workmen AIR 2006 SC 2056 (para
10) particularly.
(D) PUBLIC INTEREST AND PUBLIC POLICY:
26.1 In terms of the Scheme, all the assets as well as liabilities of the Transferor Company would be transferred to the Transferee
Company. Any particular item of assets / liabilities cannot be looked at separately. The question of IPCL reserves getting
misused or wiped out is baseless and without any substance. The allegation that the Transferee Company wants to
misutilize the assets of the Transferor Company is also baseless and without any substance. The whole of the undertakings
152
of the Transferor Company would be amalgamated with the Transferee Company for the reasons set out in the Scheme as
also in the Explanatory Statement of the Scheme.
26.2 In Re. HCL Infosystems Limited, HCL Infinet Limtied and HCL Technologies Limited (2004) Comp. Case 861 (Del), the
scheme of arrangement was challenged on the ground that the company is siphoning the profitable business. The objector
referred to a TV interview in this regard. It was held (para 31) that, “... Since in the present case the overwhelming majority of the
shareholders has approved the scheme, the same cannot override the opinion of the intervener. The allegation of the objector
that there is an effort to siphoning of the profitable business of the company in which case the minority shareholders would be
deprived of the benefit is also considered by me giving due weightage thereto. No basis is provided in support of the aforesaid
allegation. Therefore, the aforesaid contention is also without any merit”.
26.3 The third objection indirectly challenges the Government decision of disinvestment. Such type of frivolous objection cannot
be dealt with in the amalgamation proceedings and should not be considered at all by this Court while sanctioning the
Scheme.
26.4 The Scheme complies with all the procedural formalities. All the desired disclosures have been made in the Scheme.
The rationale benefits of the Scheme have been dealt with in the Scheme itself. There is no substance in the Objectors’
allegation to pierce the veil. Further, the Petitioner Company has already presented the Scheme with requisite details.
Making the Petitioner Company to further demonstrate that the Scheme is beneficial to the community at large is uncalled
for, unwarranted and not a requirement under law. The law, as settled by the Hon’ble Supreme Court is that the Scheme
should not be opposed to public policy or against public interest. The burden is on the Objectors to show that the Scheme
is opposed to public policy or public interest. They have miserably failed to do so.
26.5 The learned counsel for the petitioner relies on the decision in the case of Balco Employees Union (Regd.) vs. Union of
India, (2002) 108 Comp. Cases 193 (SC), page 236 the Hon’ble Supreme Court has observed as under:
“Wisdom and advisability of economic policies are ordinarily not amenable to judicial review unless it can be demonstrated
that the policy is contrary to any statutory provision or the Constitution. IT is not for the Court to consider relative merits
of different economic policies and consider whether a wiser or a better one can be evolved. For testing the correctness
of a policy, the appropriate forum is Parliament and not the Courts. In the matter of policy decision of economic matters,
the Courts should be very circumspect in conducting any enquiry or investigation and must be reluctant to impugn the
judgments of the experts who may have arrived at a conclusion unless the Court is satisfied that there is illegality in the
decision itself. The existence of rights of protection under Articles 14 and 16 of the Constitution cannot possibly have the
effect of vetoing the Government’s right to disinvest. Nor can the employees claim a right of continuous consultation at
different stages of the disinvestment process. If the disinvestment process is gone through without contravening any law,
then the normal consequences as a result of disinvestment must follow”.
(E) MONOPOLY STATUS:
26.6 There is no question of any monopoly status being created pursuant to amalgamation. The objectors have failed to show
as to how by merging IPCL with RIL, monopoly status would be created for RIL.
26.7 IPCL is already an associate company of RIL post disinvestment of IPCL’s shares by the Union Government in favour of
RIL. This relationship has been disclosed in the annual reports of RIL and IPCL.
26.8 The US Guidelines of Department of Justice, as relied upon by the Objectors’ Advocates are not relevant in the present
amalgamation proceedings. There is no statutory requirement restricting amalgamation of associate company with the
parent company under anti-trust laws in India.
26.9 It is, therefore, submitted that there is no question of any monopoly status being created in favour of RIL, as alleged by the
Objectors. The Regional Director and the Official Liquidator, being statutory authorities, after examining this Scheme and all
relevant correspondence and documents called for by them from the Petitioner Company, were fully satisfied with the
Scheme and certified to the Court that the Scheme was not against the public policy and that the affairs of the Petitioner
Company have not been conducted in a manner prejudicial to interest of the members or to public interest. In addition, both
Bombay Stock Exchange Limited and National Stock Exchange of India Limited had also approved the Scheme under Clause
24(f) of the Listing Agreement.
26.10 The learned counsel submits that the decision of the Gujarat High Court in Reliance Petroleum Limited vs. Union of India
(2002) (O) GLHEL 210579, para 17 (Company Petition No. 75/2002 decided on 13.9.2002), “One more objection is to the
effect that the Court should refuse to grant its approval to the Scheme on the ground of public interest as the amalgamation
will result in creation of monopoly in relation to production and marketing of goods. Nothing has been shown under any Act,
Rule or Regulation or any other law under which the Company Court cannot exercise jurisdiction to sanction a Scheme in
the event of a possibility or likelihood of monopoly resulting on the Scheme being sanctioned. The Apex Court has stated
time and again that it is for the shareholders to decide what is in the best interest of the Company and if the shareholders
have arrived at such a decision by applying approach of a prudent businessmen, it is not for Court to sit in judgment.
Furthermore, nothing has been brought on record to show that even if a monopoly results, it would affect the public interest
or the economic interest of the country adversely, which may be a factor having relevant bearing”.
26.11 The Petitioner Company relies upon the following authorities in support of the above submissions -
(a) In Re: Hindustan Lever Ltd (1995) 83 Comp. Cases 30, page 65 para F to G.
(b) In Re: Reliance Petroleum Ltd., 2002(O) GLHEL 210579 page 4, para 17.
(F) HIDDEN OBJECT AND PIERCING VEIL:
26.12 As regards hidden aspect, both the companies have shown that balance sheet, public notice has been issued. Official
liquidator has also filed report. The Regional Director has also filed report. Considering all these aspects, the hidden objects
which are being contended is not right.
153
(G) PIERCING VEIL:
26.13 As regards Piercing Veil, there are several decisions of the Hon’ble Supreme Court. In this behalf I refer to Ramaiah’s
Company Act where the learned author has discussed the point of piercing veil. If the Company wants to evade tax and if
there is any ulterior motive for amalgamation then one can lift the veil. Here there is no whisper about the same and there
is no question of lifting veil. This contention is not well founded.
(H) RE. SHARE EXCHANGE RATIO
27.1 There is no statutory requirement of carrying out valuation by independent valuers to arrive at share exchange ratio
preferably under Sections 391-394 of the Companies Act. It is only for the guidance and assistance of the Board of
Directors of companies to propose a share exchange ratio.
27.2 Further, the Share Exchange Ratio has been calculated by the recognized valuers i.e. two eminent Chartered Accountants
Firms and once the same has been decided by the valuers the Court may not go into the technicalities of the case and
adjudicate the share exchange ratio as an appellate Court.
27.3 The petitioner Company relies upon the decision in the case of Hindustan Lever’s case reported in (1995) 83 Comp.
Cases 30 (SC), at page 37, para B and C, “... the jurisdiction of the court in sanctioning a claim of merger is not to ascertain
with mathematical accuracy if the determination satisfied the arithmetical test. A Company Court does not exercise an
appellate jurisdiction. It exercises a jurisdiction founded on fairness. It is not required to interfere only because the figures
arrived at by the valuer was not as good as it would have been if another method had been adopted. What is imperative is
that such determination should not have been contrary to law and that it was not unfair for the shareholders of the company
which was being merged. The Court’s obligation is to be satisfied that valuation was in accordance with law and it was
carried out by an independent body”.
27.4 The equity shareholders of the Petitioner Company have approved the Scheme incorporating the share exchange ratio by
an overwhelming majority.
27.5 The petitioner Company relied upon the decision of the Supreme Court in Miheer H. Mafatlal vs. Mafatlal Industries Ltd.
(supra), para 40, referred to by the Gujarat High Court in Reliance Petroleum Ltd., Vs. Union of India (2002) (0) GLHEL,
210579, (Coram: D.A. Mehta, J) [Company Petition No. 75 of 2002 decided on 13.9.2002] where at para 23 the Court
observed that “... It has also to be kept in view that which exchange ratio is better is in the realm of commercial decision of
well informed equity shareholders. It is not for the Court to sit in appeal over this value judgment of equity shareholders who
are supposed to be men of world and reasonable persons who know their own benefit and interest underlying any proposed
scheme. With open eyes they have okayed this ratio and the entire scheme..”
27.6 Valuation Report was kept open for inspection for all shareholders before the meeting. Notice convening the meeting of
shareholders clearly stated that the report of the valuers was available for inspection at least for 21 days (page 292 of
the Company Petition 93 of 2007). In spite of this, none of the Objectors availed of the opportunity to inspect the same or
objected for such inspection, asking for a copy of the report.
27.7 There is no statutory requirement of circulation of valuation report to shareholders nor is there any statutory requirement of
filing a valuation report with the Court. In any case, the valuation report is part of the record of proceedings, in as much as
it is annexed with the Official Liquidator’s report submitted to this Court.
27.8 The allegation that the valuation report was not submitted even to the Court is also baseless and factually incorrect, in as
much as the Official Liquidator has annexed the said valuation report along with his report filed in the present proceedings.
In any event, the Regional Director and the Official Liquidator, being statutory authorities, had examined the valuation
report and submitted their no- objection to this Court.
27.9 For arriving at the share exchange ratio, the valuers have adopted the well known methods of (i) net assets value, (ii)
earnings value method and (iii) market value method. These methods have been approved by the Hon’ble Supreme Court
in the cases of Hindustan Lever Ltd and Mafatlal Industries Ltd.
27.10 The allegation that six polyester companies are amalgamated with IPCL in 2006 for reducing profitability of IPCL is both,
factually and legally incorrect. As a matter of fact, post amalgamation turnover and profit of IPCL have gone up. The said
amalgamation is concluded and cannot be indirectly challenged in this proceeding.
FURTHER SUBMISSIONS: SHARE EXCHANGE RATIO
28.1 It is reiterated that there is no statutory requirement of carrying out valuation exercise. It is merely a tool to assist and
guide the Board of Directors to propose a share exchange ratio for consideration of the shareholders. Further, Section 391
does not require detailed workings to be shown to shareholders/ court. The Sultania’s case relied upon by the Objectors
is not relevant in the instant case, because that case was pertaining to SEBI Takeover Regulations, which specifies
principles of valuation in case the shares are infrequently traded. Such specifications are not at all relevant in the scheme
of amalgamation under Section 391-394 of the Act. (p. 57)
“It is reiterated that in Hindustan Lever Employees Union v. Hindustan Lever Ltd., and others, (1995) 83 Comp. Cases 30
(SC), at page 57, the Supreme Court has approved the view expressed by the Gujarat High Court. It was held that “A similar
question came up for consideration before a Division Bench of this Court in the case of Jitendra R. Sukhadia vs. Alembic
Chemical Works Co. Ltd., (1987) 3 Comp LJ 141 : (1988) 64 Comp. Cases 206. That was also a case of amalgamation.
In the case, it was held that the exchange ratio of the share of the two companies, which were being amalgamated, had to
be stated alongwith the notice of the meeting. How this exchange ratio was worked out, however, was not required to be
stated in the statement contemplated under Section 393(1)(a)”.
VALUATION NOT AS PER MIHEER MAFATLAL CASE:
28.2 The petitioner Company submits that the contours laid down in the Miheer Mafatlal case have not been adhered to in the
instant case. Further, nowhere in the said case, the Supreme Court has observed that details of the working for arriving at the
share exchange ratio have to be covered in the valuation report. Therefore the allegation of the Objectors that the valuation
is not as per the Proviso to Section 391(2) of the Act and the guidelines set out in the case of Miheer Mafatlal is baseless
and without any merit.
154
VALUATION NOT AS PER HLL / TOMCO CASE:
28.3 The contention and allegation of the Objectors that all the 8 factors specified by ‘Weinberg and Blank’ in the book ‘Takeovers
and Mergers’ as referred to in HLL / TOMCO case have not been taken into account while arriving at the share exchange
ratio in the instant case is false and baseless. In fact, the Supreme Court has not mandated adherence to any one or more
of the 8 factors dealt with by Weinberg and Blank and the said factors are merely recommendatory in nature. [Please refer
page 53, paras D & E of HLL’s judgement reported in (1995) 83 Comp. Case 30]. The petitioner Company submits that
there is no merit in examining whether any one or more or all of these factors have actually been taken into account while
arriving at the share exchange ratio in the instant case. In any event, admittedly, in the instant case, the valuers have taken
into account the relevant factors and methods as set out in the valuation report to arrive at the share exchange ratio.
VALUATION NOT AS PER FEMA REGULATIONS/ CGI GUIDELINES:
28.4 The Objectors’ contention that valuation is not as per the FEMA regulations / Controller of Capital Issues (“CCI”) guidelines
is lacking in merit. The Objectors have failed to show as to which FEMA regulations are applicable for arriving at share
exchange ratio in relation of amalgamation under Sections 391-394 of the Act. Further, CCI guidelines have been repealed
way back in the year 1992.
28.5 The overall allegation of the Objectors that the Valuation Report is not proper and the Scheme is not fair and
reasonable : In re. Reliance Petroleum Ltd., 2002(O) GLHEL 210579, (supra) this Court (Coram: D.A. Mehta, J) dealt with
identical issues and held as under in para 27:
“27. Thus, by an overwhelming majority, those present have voted in favour of the resolution i.e. in favour of approving
the Scheme as per share exchange ratio proposed on the basis of the valuation report dated 3.3.2002. In these
circumstances, it is not open to the Court to hold that there was any impropriety in the valuation of the shares. In fact,
the valuation report has stated that it has based its conclusion of value on the figures of assets and liabilities of both
RPL and RIL reflected in the Balance Sheet as on 31.3.2001 along with the audited financial statement for the year
ended on 31.3.1999 and 31.3.2000. The valuation report has also taken into consideration extracts of unaudited financial
statements for the 9 months period ended on 31.12.2001. This is over and above the discussions with the management
of both RPL and RIL, other informations, explanations and representations as were required and provided by the respective
managements along with such other analysis, reviews and inquiries as were found necessary. The valuation report further
states that the valuers have not made any independent investigation and assume no responsibilities for the various
informations, details, explanations and representations placed before the valuers. It was vehemently urged during the
course of hearing that this sort of disclaimer would virtually amount to the valuers denying any responsibility as regards the
validity or genuineness of the share exchange ratio. It is necessary to note that the figure of exchange ratio arrived at by
the valuers could not be shown to be vitiated by fraud and/ or mala fide. It is settled legal position that merely because the
determination is done by a slightly different method which might result in a different conclusion would not justify interference
unless it was found to be unfair. There is nothing on record to hold that the exchange ratio, brought on record by the
aforesaid valuation report, is in any manner unjust or unfair. At the cost of repetition, it requires to be stated that it is the
commercial wisdom of the parties to the Scheme who have taken an informed decision about the usefulness and propriety
of the Scheme by supporting it by the requisite majority vote that has to to be kept in view by the Court. The Court has
neither the expertise nor the jurisdiction to delve deep into the commercial wisdom exercised by the creditors and members
of the company who have ratified the Scheme by the requisite majority”.
28.6 Therefore, the allegations of the Objectors, inter alia, that no due diligence was carried out in determining the share
exchange ratio, the valuers assumed no responsibility for valuation and they relied on the information supplied by the
management, unaudited figures were considered by the valuers etc., have all been addressed by this Court in the above
case, in particular paras 18 to 28 thereof.
28.7 The Petitioner Company relies upon the following authorities in support of the above submissions -

(I) RE: PROXIES:
29. It is a false, baseless and bald allegation that any coercive method or force was applied for signing Proxy forms.
29.1 Not a single person has addressed any letter to the Chairman of the Court convened meetings or the Company for
withdrawal of his proxy.
29.2 Even otherwise, during the meeting, the Chairman had assured that even if any of the employee shareholders had given
a proxy form earlier, but if they were present at the meeting, then they would be entitled to participate in the voting and
the proxy forms given earlier would be held invalid, while their votes would be considered. Chairman had also instructed
scrutineers accordingly. This is also stated in the Chairman’s Report submitted to this Court. Thus, there is no violation of
the provisions of the Companies Act as also of the order of this Court dated 16.3.2007 in Company Application No.126 of
2007 as alleged.
29.3 Signing of blank proxy form is not an illegality as has been held by Delhi High Court in the matter of Swadeshi Polytex Ltd.,
reported in 1988 (63) Comp. Cases 709 (pages 716 to 718).
(J) RE. DEBENTURE HOLDER.
30.1 The debenture holders do NOT constitute a separate class. They are either secured or unsecured creditors, as the case
may be. In the present case, the debenture holders of the Petitioner Company are secured creditors.
30.2 The concept of ‘preferential creditors’ is not relevant in the context of amalgamation. Section 530 of the Companies Act lists
out different categories of preferential creditors such as Government revenues, wages of workmen, provident fund, pension
fund, gratuity fund and so on. Debenture holders are NOT one among them. Like any other secured creditors, debenture
holders are entitled to lay their hands on the assets secured in their favour for recovery of their dues. They are placed on the
same footing as other secured creditors. The sub-classes of creditors may be relevant ONLY if different treatment is given/
offered in the scheme. If the same treatment is given to all secured creditors including debenture holders in the Scheme,
then there is no requirement of classifying the debenture holders as a separate class.
30.3 The petitioner Company relies on the decision of this Court in Miheer Mafatlal Industries case decided by the Division
Bench of Gujarat High Court (Coram: C.K. Thakkar (as he was then & R. Balia, JJ)) (upheld by the Supreme Court),
reported in (1996) 87 Comp. Cases 705(Guj), at page 733, para B and H, “In our opinion, a plain reading of the section does
not leave any doubt that only where separate terms are offered to separate classes of shareholders or creditors under the
proposed compromise or arrangement, separate meetings are required to be held in respect of each class of creditors or
shareholders for whom separate compromise or arrangement has been offered. The classification of members or creditors
will be founded on the basis of difference in terms offered under the Scheme. The difference in terms of the Scheme can
be the only criterion for identifying the separate class for the purpose of convening a separate meeting for such class”.
30.4 Referring to various pronouncements including the above, this High Court held in In re. Arvind Mills Ltd. (2002) 111 Comp.
Cases 118 (Guj.) that, “... The classification of members or creditors can be founded on the basis of difference in the terms
offered under the scheme. The difference in terms of the scheme can be the only criterion for identifying separate class for
the purpose of convening a separate meeting for such class”.
30.5 The petitioner Company relies on the decision of this Court in Miheer H.Mafatlal vs. Mafatlal Industries Limited, (1996)
87 Comp. Cases 792 (SC) referred to in Re. Spartek Ceramics India Limited Manu/AP/0991/2005 (Del), at para 13 of the
judgment “It is, therefore, obvious that unless a separate and different type of scheme of compromise is offered to a subclass of a class of creditors or shareholders otherwise equally circumscribed by the class, no separate class of sub-class
of the main class of members or creditors is required to be convened.”
30.6 The petitioner submitted that as consistently, held by the Courts that the classification of creditors should be based on the
treatment which is being offered to them under the scheme of arrangement. Merely because debenture holders have first
charge does not make them a separate class distinct from other secured creditors.
30.7 Merely because the Companies Act provides for provisions like creation of security, debenture redemption reserve etc.,
under Sections 117A - 117C, debenture holders will not constitute as a separate class from among the secured creditors.
In Re: Siel Ltd, 2004 (122) Com. Cases 536 (Del), Manu/DE/0666/2003, pages 13, 14, 16 and In Re: Spartek Ceramics
Ltd, Manu/AP/0991/2005 para 13.
30.8 Disclosures in balance sheet are as per the statutory requirements of Schedule VI to the Companies Act and the applicable
accounting standards. Further, mere disclosures cannot make debenture holders a separate class of stakeholders. On
the contrary, in a balance sheet of a company drawn up in the form given in Schedule VI, debenture holders are classified
under “Secured Creditors”.
30.9 It was held in National Rayon Corporation Ltd. vs. Commissioner of Income Tax, AIR 1997 SC 3487, page 3490, para 12,
that “... debentures were nothing but the secured loans. Merely because the debentures were not redeemable during the
accounting period, the liability to redeem the debentures did not cease to exist. It was redeemable or repayable at a future
date. But it was a known liability. In the form of balance sheet prescribed by the Act in Schedule VI, the secured loans have
to be shown under the heading ‘liabilities’. Secured loans include (i) debentures, (ii) loans and advances from banks, (iii)
loans and advances from subsidiaries, and (iv) other loans and advances. The secured loans might not be immediately
repayable, but the liability to repay these loans was an existing liability and has to be shown in the company’s balance sheet
for the relevant year of accounts as a liability...”
30.10 Articles of Association of IPCL contains the standard provisions based on the provisions of the Companies Act read with
Table - A. There is no specific provision treating debenture holders as a class separate from the other secured creditors.
30.11 Further, the petitioner Company submits that the Objectors’ contention that the Chairman’s Report ought to have specified
the voting pattern of secured creditors and debenture holders separately, is again without any substance and statutory
backing.

The Petitioner Company humbly submits that the objections raised against the Scheme are baseless and without any
substance. Moreover, almost all the similar objections have been discarded by various courts including the Hon’ble
Supreme Court and this Court in a number of cases.
30.13 Therefore, the petitioner company submits before this Court that the prayers (a) to (h) sought in the petition be allowed and
that the scheme be sanctioned.
OBSERVATIONS AND CONCLUSIONS: (Regarding Jurisdiction of the Court)
31. This Court has considered the facts of the case, objections raised by several objectors and also Company’s reply to the objections.
Before this Court considers the objections raised against the proposed scheme of amalgamation, this Court considers: (1) the
parameters of the Court’s jurisdiction regarding legality and validity of the scheme; (2) objections raised by several objectors and
(3) Scheme of Sections 391 to 394 and the relevant aspects about the same.
RE: PARAMETERS OF COURT’S JURISDICTION:
31.1 In this regard I first rely upon the judgement of the Hon’ble Supreme Court in the case of HINDUSTAN LEVER EMPLOYEES’
UNION VS. HINDUSTAN LEVER LTD. AND OTHERS reported in 83 Company Cases 30. The said judgement has been
delivered by 3 Judges Bench (Coram: M.N. Venkatachaliah, C.J.I., R.M. Sahai and S.C. Sen, JJ). In this judgement Hon’ble
Mr. Justice M.N. Venkatachaliah, CJI and Hon’ble Mr. Justice S.C. Sen, have given one judgement (majority judgement)
whereas Hon’ble Mr. Justice R.M. Sahai has given separate but concurring judgement.
31.2 As regards Court’s jurisdiction I first rely on the judgement of Hon’ble Mr. Justice R.M. Sahai on page Nos. 37-38 which
reads as under:
31.2A “But what was lost sight of is that the jurisdiction of the Court in sanctioning a claim of merger is not to ascertain with
mathematical accuracy if the determination satisfied the arithmetical test. A company court does not exercise an appellate
jurisdiction. It exercises a jurisdiction founded on fairness. It is not required to interfere only because the figure arrived
at by the valuer was not as good as it would have been if another method had been adopted. What is imperative is that
such determination should not have been contrary to law and that it was not unfair for the shareholders of the company
which was being merged. The court’s obligation is to be satisfied that valuation which was in accordance with law and it was
carried out by an independent body. The High Court appears to be correct in its approach that this test was satisfied as,
even though the chartered accountant who performed this function was a director of TOMCO, he did so as a member of a
renowned firm of chartered accountants. His determination was further got checked and approved by two other independent
bodies at the instance of the shareholders of TOMCO by the High Court and it has been found that the determination did
not suffer from any infirmity. The company court, therefore, did not commit any error in refusing to interfere with it. May
be, as argued by learned counsel for the petitioner, if some other method had been adopted probably the determination
of valuation could have been a bit more in favour of the shareholders. But since admittedly more than 95 per cent of the
shareholders who are the best judge of their interest and are better conversant with market trends agreed to the valuation
determined it could not be interfered by courts as “certainly, it is not part of the judicial process to examine entrepreneurial
activities to ferret out flaws. The court is least equipped for such oversights. Nor, indeed, is it a function of the judges in
our constitutional scheme. We do not think that the internal management, business activity or institutional operation of
public bodies can be subjected to inspection by the court. To do so, is incompetent and improper and, therefore, out of
bounds. Nevertheless, the broad parameters of fairness in administration, bona fides in action and the fundamental rules of
reasonable management of public business, if breached, will become justiciable” [Fertilizer Corporation Kamgar Union V.
Union of India (1981) 2 SCR 52 : (1981) 59 FJR 237, 257 (See: Buckley on the Companies Acts, fourteenth edition, pages
473 and 474 and Palmer on Company Law, twenty-third edition, para 79.16]” (Emphasis added)
31.3 In the same judgement the Hon’ble Supreme Court (i.e. same learned Judge) further observed at pages 39-40 as under:
“Section 394 casts an obligation on the court to be satisfied that the scheme for amalgamation or merger was not contrary
to public interest. The basic principle of such satisfaction is none other than the broad and general principles inherent
in any compromise or settlement entered into between parties that it should not be unfair or contrary to public policy or
unconscionable. In amalgamation of companies, the Courts have evolved, the principle of “prudent business management
test” or that the scheme should not be a device to evade law. But when the court is concerned with a scheme of merger
with a subsidiary of a foreign company then the test is not only whether the scheme shall result in maximising the profits of
the shareholders or whether the interest of employees was protected but it has to ensure that the merger shall not result
in impeding promotion of industry or obstruct the growth of national economy. Liberalised economic policy is to achieve
this goal. The merger, therefore, should not be contrary to this objective. Reliance on the English decision for Hoare, In
157
re (1933) All ER 105 (Ch D) and Bugle Press Ltd., In re (1961) Ch 270 that the power of the Court is to be satisfied only
whether the provisions of the Act have been complied with or that the class or classes were fully represented and the
arrangement was such as a man of business would reasonably approve between two private companies may be correct
and may normally be adhered to but when the merger is with a subsidiary of a foreign company then economic interest of
the country may have to be given precedence. The jurisdiction of the court in this regard is comprehensive.” (Emphasis
added)
31.4 The majority judgement starts from pages 65-66 of the said judgement which reads as under:
“An argument was also made that as a result of the amalgamation a large share of the market will be captured by HLL.
But there is nothing unlawful or illegal about this. The court will decline to sanction a scheme of merger, if any tax fraud or
any other illegality is involved. But that is not the case here. A company may, on its own, grow to capture a large share of
the market. But unless it is shown that there is some illegality or fraud involved in the scheme, the court cannot decline to
sanction a scheme of amalgamation. It has to be borne in mind that this proposal of amalgamation arose out of a sharp
decline in the business of TOMCO. Dr. Dhavan has argued that TOMCO is not yet a sick company. That may be right, but
TOMCO at this rate will become a sick company, unless something can be done to improve its performance. In the last two
years, it has sold its investments and other properties. If this proposal of amalgamation is not sanctioned, the consequence
for TOMCO may be very serious. The shareholders, the employees, the creditors will all suffer. The argument that the
company has large assets is really meaningless. Very many cotton mills and jute mills in India have become sick and are
on the verge of liquidation, even though they have large assets. The scheme has been sanctioned almost unanimously
by the shareholders, debenture holders, secured creditors, unsecured creditors and preference shareholders of both the
companies. There must exist very strong reasons for withholding sanction to such a scheme. Withholding of sanction may
turn out to be disastrous for the 60,000 shareholders of TOMCO and also a large number of its employees.” (Emphasis
added)
31.4A Further reliance is placed on the decision of the Hon’ble Supreme Court in the case of MIHEER H. MAFATLAL VS.
MAFATLAL INDUSTRIES LTD. reported in (1997) 1 SCC 579. In the aforesaid matter at paragraph No. 28 the Hon’ble
Supreme Court has considered scope of interference by the Company Court in sanction proceedings. The Court has
relied on Sections 391 to 394 of the Companies Act and thereafter relied on the passage of Buckley on the Companies
Act, 14th Edition (page 473- 474), then the judgements in the case of ALABAMA, NEW ORLEANS, TEXAS AND PACIFIC
JUNCTION RLY. CO. [Re 1 (1891) 1 Ch. 213 : (1886-90) All ER Rep. Ext. 1143]; ANGLO CONTINENTAL SUPPLY CO.
LTD. [Re (1922) 2 Ch 723 : 91 LJ Ch 658]; EMPLOYEES’ UNION V. HINDUSTAN LEVER LTD. 1995 Supp (1) SCC 499
and ultimately on pages 601-602 the Hon’ble Supreme Court has observed as under: (per S.B. Majmudar, J)
31.4B “In view of the aforesaid settled legal position, therefore, the scope and ambit of the jurisdiction of the Company Court has
clearly got earmarked. The following broad contours of such jurisdiction have emerged:
1. The sanctioning court has to see to it that all the requisite statutory procedure for supporting such a scheme has
been complied with and that the requisite meetings as contemplated by Section 391(1) (a) have been held.
2. That the scheme put up for sanction of the Court is backed up by the requisite majority vote as required by Section
391 sub-section (2).
3. That the meetings concerned of the creditor or members or any class of them had the relevant material to enable
the voters to arrive at an informed decision for approving the scheme in question. That the majority decision of
the concerned class of voters is just and fair to the class as a whole so as to legitimately bind even the dissenting
members of that class.
4. That all necessary material indicated by Section 393 (1)(a) is placed before the voters at the concerned meetings
as contemplated by Section 391, sub-section (1).
5. That all the requisite material contemplated by the proviso to sub-section (2) of Section 391 of the Act is placed
before the Court by the concerned applicant seeking sanction for such a scheme and the Court gets satisfied about
the same.
6. That the proposed scheme of compromise and arrangement is not found to be violative of any provision of law and
is not contrary to public policy. For ascertaining the real purpose underlying the Scheme with a view to be satisfied
on this aspect, the Court, if necessary, can pierce the veil of apparent corporate purpose underlying the scheme
and can judiciously X-ray the same.
7. That the Company Court has also to satisfy itself that members or class of members or creditors or class of
creditors, as the case may be, were acting bona fide and in good faith and were not coercing the minority in order
to promote any interest adverse to that of the latter comprising of the same class whom they purported to represent.
8. That the scheme as a whole is also found to be just, fair and reasonable from the point of view of prudent men of
business taking a commercial decision beneficial to the class represented by them for whom the scheme is meant.
9. Once the aforesaid broad parameters about the requirement of a scheme for getting sanction of the Court are
found to have been met, the Court will have no further jurisdiction to sit in appeal over the commercial wisdom
of the majority of the class of persons who with their open eyes have given their approval to the scheme even if
in the view of the Court there would be a better scheme for the company and its members or creditors for whom
the scheme is framed. The Court cannot refuse to sanction such a scheme on that ground as it would otherwise
amount to the Court exercising appellate jurisdiction over the scheme rather than its supervisory jurisdiction. The
aforesaid parameters of the scope and ambit of the jurisdiction of the Company Court which is called upon to
sanction a Scheme of Compromise and Arrangement are not exhaustive but only broadly illustrative of the contours
of the Court’s jurisdiction.” (Emphasis added)
31.5 Reliance is further placed on the decision of the Hon’ble Supreme Court in the case of HINDUSTAN LEVER AND
ANOTHER VS. STATE OF MAHARASHTRA AND ANOTHER reported in (2004) 9 SCC 438, particularly paragraph No.
12 on page 449 which reads as follows: “para 12 - Two broad principles underlying a scheme of amalgamation which have
been brought out in this judgement are:
158
1. That the order passed by the Court amalgamating the company is based on a compromise or arrangement arrived
at between the parties; and
2. That the jurisdiction of the Company Court while sanctioning the scheme is supervisory only i.e. to observe that the
procedure set out in the Act is met and complied with and that the proposed scheme of compromise or arrangement
is not violative of any provision of law, unconscionable or contrary to public policy. The court is not to exercise the
appellate jurisdiction and examine the commercial wisdom of the compromise or arrangement arrived at between
the parties. The role of the court is that of an umpire in a game, to see that the teams play their role as per rules
and do not overstep the limits. Subject to that how best the game is to be played is left to the players and not to the
umpire. Both these principles indicate that there is no adjudication by the court on the merits as such.”
31.6 In paragraph No. 32 on page 457 of the said judgement the Hon’ble Supreme Court has further observed thus:
“para 32 - In view of the aforesaid discussion, we hold that the order passed by the Court under Section 394 of the
Companies Act is based upon the compromise between two or more companies. Function of the court while sanctioning
the compromise or arrangement is limited to oversee that the company were not conducted in a manner prejudicial to
the interest of its members or to public interest, that is to say, it should not be unfair or contrary to public policy or
unconscionable. Once these things are satisfied the scheme has to be sanctioned as per the compromise arrived at
between the parties.” (Emphasis added)
31.7 I also rely on Palmer’s Company Law 25th Edition (1992) page 12035 where the learned author has discussed the scheme,
“Exercise of the Court’s discretion” at paragarph No. 12.026 to 12.030 where the learned author has stated that before the
Court sanctions a scheme it will normally need to be satisfied on four matters: (1) The statutory provisions must have been
complied with; (2) The class must have been fairly represented; (3) The arrangement must be such as a man of business
would reasonably approve; and (4) The arrangement must be compatible with Section 428.
31.8 Similarly Buckley on the Companies Act, (2001 Edition) under the heading “Function of the Court” at para 425.53 is
relied on where it is stated as under: “Once the meetings have approved the scheme, the sanction of the Court must be
sought. The sanction of the Court is not a formality. The Court has an unfettered discretion as to whether or not to sanction
the scheme, but it is likely to do so, so long as: (1) the provisions of the statute have been complied with, (2) the class
was fairly represented by those who attended the meeting and that the statutory majority are acting bona fide and are not
coercing the minority in order to promote interests adverse to those of the class whom they purport to represent, and (3)
that the arrangement is such as an intelligent and honest man, a member of the class concerned and acting in respect of
his interest, might reasonably approve”.
31.9 Further Reliance is placed on Halsbury’s Laws of England, 4th Edition, Vol. 7(2), pages 1092-1093 where under the
heading “The Making of Schemes” at para 1447 Sanctioning compromise or arrangement it is stated as follows:
“If a majority in number representing three-fourths in value of the creditors or class of creditors or members or class of
members, as the case may be, present and voting either in person or by proxy at the meeting agree to any compromise
or arrangement, the compromise or arrangement, if sanctioned by the Court, is binding on all the creditors or the class
of creditors, or on the members or class of members, as the case may be, and also on the company or, in the case of a
company in the course of being wound up, on the liquidator and contributories of the Company.
The compromise proposed must be within the power of the company to effect, and, if not, its memorandum of association
must be altered before the compromise will be approved.
The interests of creditors must always be safeguarded; but in the case of a scheme which involves the application of the
provisions of the Companies Act, 1985 for facilitating such reconstruction or amalgamations, the protection of the creditors
is to be left to the procedure in relation to such provisions.”
GUJARAT HIGH COURT DECISIONS:
31.10 As regards this High Court, I rely on the decision of this Court in the case of In re SIDHPUR MILLS CO. LTD., reported
in AIR 1962 Guj. 305, the judgement was delivered by the Court (Coram: N.M. Miabhoy, J as he was then). The learned
Judge has discussed various English cases at pages 308 to 311 in para 14 and in para 15 on page 311 the learned Judge
has laid down the following principles:
“Para 15 - Therefore, in my judgement, the correct approach to the present case is (i) to ascertain whether the statutory
requirements have been complied with, and (ii) to determine whether the scheme as a whole has been arrived at by the
majority bona fide and in the interests of the whole body of shareholders in whose interests the majority purported to act,
and (iii) to see whether the scheme is such that a fair and reasonable shareholder will consider it to be for the benefit of
the Company and for himself. The scheme should not be scrutinized in the way of carping critic, a hair-splitting expert, a
meticulous accountant or a fastidious counsel would do it, each trying to find out from his professional point of view what
loopholes are present in the scheme, what technical mistakes have been committed, what accounting errors have crept in
or what legal rights of one or the other sides have or have not been protected. It must be tested from the point of view of an
ordinary reasonable shareholder, acting in a business-like manner, taking within his comprehension and bearing in mind
all the circumstances prevailing at the time when the meeting was called upon to consider the scheme in question. I am
emphasizing the last point because an argument was made by Mr. Amin that certain circumstances or events which took
place after the scheme had been considered should be taken into account. I do not wish to be understood to say that, in
no case post facto circumstances or events cannot be taken into account, but, on the whole I have come to the conclusion
that, whilst, in some rare and exceptional cases, the Court may take into consideration subsequent events to protect the
interests of the Company or the shareholders, as a general rule, the Court should consider the resolution on the footing of
the circumstances which were in existence at the time when the scheme was formulated, deliberated upon and approved.
If any other approach were to be made, then, in that case, there would be no sanctity about business contracts. In fact,
such an approach may include interested persons to shape future events and circumstances in such a way as to convert a
reasonable scheme into an unreasonable one (Emphasis added).”

31.11 Another judgement of this Court is In re MANECKCHOWK AND AHMEDABAD MANUFACTURING CO. LTD. reported
(1970) 40 Company Cases 819, (D.A. Desai, J (as he was then) relevant pages 901-902 where the learned Judge has
referred to para 15 of the aforesaid judgement (In re Sidhpur Mills Co. Ltd.) and ultimately held as under:
“This must be the approach of the court while examining the scheme and the court should, keeping in view all the aspects of
the matter, prefer a living scheme to compulsory liquidation bringing about an end to a company. Reference may be made
to Lawrence Dawson V. J. Hormasji (reported in AIR 1932 Rang. 154, 162). Cunliffe J, has observed as under:
‘The Court is of course not a mere machine for registration. It will look into the proposed scheme much as a court of appeal
will canvass, if asked to do so, the decision of a jury, to ascertain if there was reasonable evidence to support their verdict;
but it will, I think, always also prefer a living scheme to a compulsory liquidation bringing about an end to a company, and
usually without any hope of payment in full.’ The Court in exercising its discretion under Section 391(2) must treat it as
cardinal that its function does not extend to usurping the view of the members or creditors. It must look at the scheme to see
that it is a reasonable one and while so doing, the court will be strongly influenced by a big majority vote and the reasons
which actuated the contesting creditors in opposing the scheme. None the less it is essential that the scheme must be a
fair and equitable one though it is none of the business of the court to judge upon the commercial merits which in fact is the
function of the creditors and members.” (Emphasis added)
31.12 I also rely upon the judgement of this Court in the case of BHAVNAGAR VEGETABLE PRODUCTS LTD., In re reported
in 55 Company Cases 107. First I rely on the judgement of the learned Single Judge (Ahmadi, J (as he was then)). The
learned Judge has referred to the judgement of this Court in Sidhpur Mills Co. Ltd.’s case (supra) in para 59 and in
paragraph 60 the learned Judge has also referred to the judgement of this Court in In re Maneckchowk & Ahmedabad Mfg.
Co. Ltd. [1970] 40 Comp. Cas. 819 (Guj). Paragraph No. 15 in Sidhpur Mill’s case and paragraph 16 in Maneckchowk &
Ahmedabad Mfg. Co. Ltd.’s case (supra) have been referred and ultimately in paragraph Nos. 63-64, this Court laid down
the principle regarding sanctioning of the Scheme. Against the said judgement, appeal was filed and the Division Bench of
this Court (Coram: M.P. Thakkar (as he then was) & R.C. Mankad, JJ) dismissed the appeal and approved the judgement
of the learned Single Judge of this Court. Thus, the judgement in the case of Sidhpur Mill (supra) has been followed by this
Court, learned Single Judge as well as the Division Bench.
31.13 I also refer to the Division Bench judgement of this Court (Coram: R.C. Mankad and P.M. Chauhan, JJ) in the case of
JITENDRA R. SUKHADIA VS. ALEMBIC CHEMICAL WORKS COMPANY LTD. reported in 64 Company Cases 206,
particularly relevant pages 215-216 where the Court has observed as under:
“With respect, we are in full agreement with the view of N.M. Miabhoy J (as he then was). (Re: Sidhpur Mills Co. Ltd. which
I earlier referred to). xxxxxxxxxx It is only the resultant effect of the scheme which is required to be stated. As observed in
Sidhpur Mills Co. Ltd., In re, AIR 1962 Guj. 305, if there is anything in the scheme of compromise or arrangement which is
not quite obvious to a person reasonably acquainted with the facts of the case by merely reading the terms of the scheme,
then a duty is cast upon the persons concerned to mention what the consequence will be if the scheme is approved of. If
something is implied in the scheme which is not obvious, it must be brought to the notice of the creditors and shareholders.
In the instant case, the share exchange ratio is clearly mentioned in the scheme. In other words, it is made clear that
in case the amalgamation of Neomer with the respondent company is approved, the shareholders of Neomer would be
entitled to one share of the respondent company in exchange for 40 shares of Neomer. In what manner this exchange
ratio was worked out is not a matter which was required to be stated in the statement contemplated under Section 393(1)
(a). Once this effect of the scheme, namely, that the shareholders of Neomer, would, as a result of the amalgamation, get
one share of the respondent company in exchange for 40 shares of Neomer was stated, there was sufficient explanation of
the effect of the scheme to the shareholders of the respondent company so far as the share exchange ratio is concerned.
How the share exchange ratio was worked out was not the “effect” of the scheme; but a detail, which was not required to
be stated in the statement. Once the share exchange ratio was clearly stated, the shareholders of both the companies,
that is, the respondent company and Neomer, would be put on alert, if they had any doubt regarding the share exchange
ratio and the working thereof. Once the effect of the scheme is explained, the duty cast under clause (a) of section 393(1)
is discharge and nothing more was required to be done for complying with the said provision. We, therefore, find ourselves
unable to accept Mr. Pujara’s contention that in the absence of details regarding working of the share exchange ratio in
the statement, there was failure on the part of the persons concerned to comply with the provisions of clause (a) of Section
393(1) of the Companies Act; and, consequently, the shareholders of the respondent company could not arrive at an
informed decision whether or not to approve the scheme of amalgamation.” (Emphasis added).
31.13A BANK OF BARODA LTD. VS. MAHINDRA UGINE STEEL CO. LTD. reported in 46 Company Cases 227 where at pages
244 the Court has observed as under: (per P.D. Desai, J (as he was then))
“In view of the foregoing discussion it appears to me that the Court cannot abdicate its duty to scrutinise the scheme with
vigilance and act as a mere rubber stamp simply because the statutory majority has approved it and there is no opposition
to the scheme in the court. So much weight cannot be attached to the views of the statutory majority as to require the
court to mechanically put its imprimatur on the scheme. The Court is not upon a casual look at it. It must still scrutinise the
scheme to find out whether it is a reasonable arrangement which can by reasonable people conversant with the subject be
regarded as beneficial to those who are likely to be affected by it. In the pursuit of such inquiry, the Court is not tied down
by any rigid principles or strait-jacket formula and no enumeration contained in judicial decisions of the factors which can
be taken into account, howsoever precise, can be treated as exhaustive so as to limit the scope of the inquiry which having
regard to the varying circumstances, might differ from case to case. The burden lies on the petitioner-company to show that
the scheme of amalgamation is fair, reasonable, workable and such that a man of business would reasonably approve. The
court would, of course, take into account the fact that it has been approved by a big majority vote, but it would not shirk its
duty to scrutinise the scheme, especially when it involves amalgamation of large companies in which many interests are at
stake.”
31.14 This Court also refers to the judgement of my learned brother Mr. Justice D.A. Mehta in the case of RELIANCE PETROLEUM
LIMITED VERSUS UNION OF INDIA reported in 2002(0) GLHEL 210579 (Company Petition No. 75/2002 decided on 13.9.2002
wherein at paragraph No. 22 the learned Single Judge has observed as under:
160
“The position in law is well settled that while exercising the jurisdiction and power to sanction a Scheme, the Court is
required to ensure that statutory provisions have been complied with, that the class of persons who attended the meeting
was fairly represented and that the statutory majority was acting bona fide and lastly that the arrangement i.e. Scheme
was such which an intelligent and honest man, acting in respect of his interest, might reasonably approve. The Court, at
the same time, is not required to differ from the decision of the majority arrived at the meeting unless any of the factor was
found to be wanting. A share exchange valuation will have to be approved unless it shocks the conscience of the Court.”
(Emphasis added)
31.15 This Court also further refers to the decisions of this Court (Coram: N.G. Nandi, J) in the case of In Re: ARVIND MILLS
LTD.; (Coram: Anant S. Dave, J) in the case of TORRENT POWER AEC LTD., In re. reported in (2007) 138 Comp Cas 139
(Guj) and (Coram: R.S. Garg, J) in the case of CORE HEALTH CARE LTD.,In Re.
31.16 All the above judgements of the learned Single Judges of this Court have taken same and similar view.
SCOPE OF INTERFERENCE OF COURT IN AMALGAMATION MATTER:
Re.: English Court Approach
32.1 The first decision is In re Alabama, New Orleans, Texas and Pacific Junction Railway Company, reported in 1891 Law
Reports (Chancery Division) (Ch.1), page 213, relevant page 238 (per Lindley, J).
“I think that is very likely, but, still, there is the statute, and what the Court has to do is to see, first of all, that the provisions of
that statute have been complied with; and, secondly, that the majority has been acting bona fide. The Court also has to see
that the minority is not being overridden by a majority having interests of its own clashing with those of the minority whom
they seek to coerce. Further than, that, the Court has to look at the scheme and see whether it is one as to which persons
acting honestly, and viewing the scheme laid before them in the interests of those whom they represent, take a view which
can be reasonably taken by business men. The Court must look at the scheme, and see whether the Act has been complied
with, whether the majority are acting bona fide, and whether they are coercing the minority in order to promote interests
adverse to those of the class whom they purport to represent; and then see whether the scheme is a reasonable one or
whether there is any reasonable objection to it, or such an objection to it as that any reasonable man might say that he
could not approve of it.
32.2 Similar view has been also expressed in, In re Anglo- Continental Supply Company Limited, reported in 1922 Law Reports
(Chancery Division) (Ch.2), page 723, relevant page 736.
“In exercising its power of sanction under section 120 the Court will see: First, that the provisions of the statute have been
complied with. Secondly, that the class was fairly represented by those who attended the meeting and that the statutory
majority are acting bona fide and are not coercing the minority in order to promote interests adverse to those of the class
whom they purport to represent, and, Thirdly, that the arrangement is such as a man of business would reasonably
approve”.
32.3 From the aforesaid two English cases namely, In Re Alabama, New Orleans, Texas and Pacific Junction Railway Company
and Anglo-Continental Supply Company Limited where the Court has referred to Treaties of Buckley, 9th Edition, 275 and
laid down the principle regarding parameters of Court’s jurisdiction. In the earlier part of this judgement, this Court has
relied on Palmers on Company Law as well as Buckley on Companies Acts, 2000 at para 425.53. If one examines the said
para then the aforesaid two cases have been followed by several English cases subsequently and the last case is RAC
Motoring Services Ltd. (2000) 1 BCLC 307. [Re.: Buckley on the Companies Law, 2000 Edn. Para 425.53.]
OBSERVATION & CONCLUSION REGARDING ANCILLARY INDUSTRIES.
33.1 This Court has considered the submissions made by Mr.P.R. Thakkar, learned advocate who appears on behalf of Rachana
Polypack as well as Schon Plastic Pvt. Ltd. Mr.Shalin Mehta, learned advocate has also supported him in this behalf. Mr.
K. S. Nanavati, learned Senior Counsel has replied to the said submissions in this behalf. This Court has considered the
tender notice for inviting application for establishing ancillary industries and letter of intent issued by IPCL. This Court
also considered the provisions of Industries (Development and Regulation) Act, 1951, which has been referred to by the
learned counsel in this behalf. It appears that the ancillary industry filed a petition before the Bombay High Court claiming
relief that the High Court may issue a writ of mandamus to the respondents particularly respondent No. 4 IPCL to comply
with the commitments that IPCL/respondents have made to the petitioners through their Letter of Intent dated 9.10.1992
and other reliefs and the Bombay High Court has passed the order that relief which the petitioner in that petition who is
applicant herein before this Court as claimed can be claimed either in Civil Court or in conciliation, mediation or arbitration.
Accordingly, the applicant has filed application for resolving dispute by arbitrator as suggested by Bombay High Court.
33.2 As per the order of the Bombay High Court dated 17.2.2005 where the Bombay High Court held that appropriate remedy
for the reliefs claimed in the said petition lies before the Civil Court of appropriate jurisdiction. The applicant has filed suit
one before the Baroda Court against IPCL for specific performance of contract and alternative claim for damages and also
another in Raighad Civil Court. Before this Court, the learned counsel has also relied upon the proceedings of Civil Court.
33.3 In terms of Clause 6 of the Scheme, upon amalgamation becoming effective, all the suits and legal proceedings pending
by or against IPCL would be continued by or against the Transferee Company and whatever the applicant obtained by
way of decree or relief either from Baroda Court or from Raighad Court, the same will be binding upon the Transferee
Company. The applicants have apprehended in one matter that they have filed a suit in Baroda Court on the ground that
the registered office of IPCL is situated at Baroda, however in view of amalgamation, the Transferee Company will cease to
have registered office at Baroda and the Transferee Company has its registered office situated at Mumbai. If this happens,
the trial Court at Vadodara may lose the jurisdiction. This Court has considered the said objection in this behalf. In my view
the entire objection of the applicants is misplaced. In view of Clause 6 of the Scheme, whatever proceedings have been
filed by the applicant in Baroda Court as well as Raighad Court, and if any decree is passed, the same will be binding on
the Transferee Company.
33.4 As regards losing of the jurisdiction, one has to refer to Section 20 of the Code of Civil Procedure which provides subject
to the limitations aforesaid, every suit shall be instituted in a Court within the local limits of whose jurisdiction, the cause of
action, wholly or in part arises or the defendant carries on business.
161
33.5 It is well settled principle of law that cause of action means a right to sue. It consists of material facts which are imperative
for the plaintiff to allege and prove. The cause of action may be described as “a bundle of essential facts, which it is
necessary for the plaintiff to prove before he can succeed”, or “which gives the plaintiff right to relief against the defendant”.
In this behalf this Court relies upon the judgement of Hon’ble Apex Court in the case of A.B.C. Laminart Pvt. Ltd. vs. A.P.
Agencies reported in (1989) 2 SCC 163 : AIR 1989 SC 1239. According to Hon’ble Supreme Court, the cause of action
means every fact, which if traversed, it would be necessary for the plaintiff to prove in order to support his right to a
judgment of the Court. In other words, it is a bundle of facts which taken with the law applicable to them gives the plaintiff a
right to relief against the defendant. It does not comprise evidence necessary to prove such facts, but every fact necessary
for the plaintiff to prove to enable him to obtain a decree. The said judgment also provides that the cause of action has no
relation whatever to the defence which may be set up by the defendant nor does it depend upon the character of the relief
prayed for by the plaintiff.
33.6 Moreover, a company is considered to be carrying on its business at the place where its registered office is situated in
addition to other places. As such, the Court where its registered office is situated has jurisdiction to try the suit. The question
whether a court has jurisdiction is to be decided on the facts that exist at the time when the suit is filed and if, the Court has
jurisdiction accordingly, any subsequent change in the facts cannot divest it of its jurisdiction. Thus, in the present case,
when the Vadodara Court or Raigadh Court has jurisdiction at the time when the suit was filed since the registered office of
the Company was situated within it, any subsequent change in the registered office will not defeat the suit nor will it divest
the court of its jurisdiction which it had when the suit was filed.
33.7 It is directed by way of clarification that the Civil Suits filed by the ancillary industries against the transferor Company both
at Vadodara Court in Gujarat and Raighad Court in Maharashtra shall be continued against the transferee Company after
amalgamation order. The final decree (i.e. subject to challenge by the either party) that may be passed by the concerned
Courts shall be binding on the transferee Company.
OBSERVATION & CONCLUSION RE: SC/ST RESERVATION:
34.1 This Court heard the submissions of Mr.Ramnandan Singh on behalf of some of the employees who belong to IPCL. This
Court has also gone through Article 16(4) of the Constitution of India which provides that this it shall not prevent the State
from making any provision for the reservation of appointments or posts in favour of any backward class of citizens, which,
in the opinion of the State, is not adequately represented in the services under the State and Article 16(4A) provides
that it shall not prevent the State from making any provision for reservation or classes of posts in the service under the
State in favour of the Scheduled Castes and the Scheduled Tribes, which in the opinion of the State, are not adequately
represented in the services under the State.
34.2 It appears some of the said employees have filed a petition before this Court regarding objection on amalgamation of the
transferor Company, i.e. IPCL with the transferee Company, i.e. RIL. In that matter, this Court has passed an order on 8th
May 2007 and directed them to make representation to the Government. In the event their rights are prejudiced, they can
approach appropriate forum.
34.3 This Court has been informed that pursuant to the order of this Court, the employees have filed representations dated
5.6.2007 to the Central Government in connection with their objection to the merger or transfer of the transferor Company
with the transferee Company.
34.4 It is no doubt true that the petitioner Company has objected to the said part, but if this Court directs that when the Central
Government decides the representation of the SC/ST, the petitioner Company as well as transferee Company may be
heard and they may put forward their case and after hearing the petitioner Company, IPCL or RIL after amalgamation, if
the Central Govt. passes any order, the same will be binding on the workers as well as the transferee Company. However,
it is directed by way of clarification that while considering the objections filed by the SC/ST employees dated 5.6.2007
before the Ministry of Chemicals and Petrochemicals, the said authority will pass order after hearing the said employees
and also the transferee Company. The authority will pass a reasoned order. Such order will be subject to challenge by the
either party before the appropriate forum in appropriate proceedings and the finally adjudicated order will be binding on the
parties.
OBSERVATIONS & CONCLUSIONS RE: WORKERS MATTER.
35.1 The question whether the workers have right to be heard in connection with the scheme of amalgamation - in that connection
this Court considered Sections 391 to 394 of the Companies Act. The said Sections provide consultation with the secured
creditors, unsecured creditors and shareholders. They do not provide any consultation or hearing of the workers before the
scheme of amalgamation is considered by two respective Companies particularly by transferor company and transferee
Company also.
35.2 Over and above this, the Court has considered the relevant Rules of Company (Court) Rules. As regards compromise,
arrangement or amalgamation, there are Company (Court) Rules - Rule 67 provides for summons for directions to
convene a meeting, an advertisement must be in Form No. 33 and affidavit in support thereof in Form No. 34. Rule 69
provides for directions at hearing of summons which provides that the Company has to obtain directions in connection
with determining the class or classes of creditors and/or members whose meeting or meetings have to be held for
considering the proposed compromise or arrangement; fixing the time and place of such meeting or meetings; appointing
a Chairman or Chairmen for the meeting or meetings to be held, as the case may be; fixing the quorum and the procedure
to be followed at the meeting or meetings including voting by proxy; determining the values of the creditors and/or the
members, or the creditors or members of any class, as the case may be, whose meetings have to be held; notice to be
given of the meeting or meetings and the advertisement of such notice; the time within which the Chairman of the meeting
is to report to the Court the result of the meeting; and such other matters as the Court may deem necessary. It is no doubt
true that these Rules provide for meetings of secured creditors and the members. Rule 73 of the Company Court Rules
provides for notice of meeting. Rule 74 provides for advertisement of the notice of meeting. Rule 75 provides for copy of
compromise or arrangement to be furnished by the Company, Rule 76 provides for affidavit of service, Rule 77 provides
for result of the meeting to be decided by poll, Rule 78 provides for report of the result of the meeting, Rule 79 provides for
petition for confirming compromise or arrangement; Rule 80 provides for date and notice of hearing and Rule 81 provides
162
order on petition. Rule 82 provides application for directions under Section 394, Rule 83 provides for directions at hearing
of application, Rule 84 provides for order under Section 394. Rule 86 provides for report on working of compromise or
arrangement; Rule 87 provides for liberty to apply. All these Rules show that regarding amalgamation various notices and
advertisements have to be published.
35.3 In view of this, a conjoint reading of the Act and the Rules also provides that the workers have no right to be heard or
consulted before or at the time the scheme of amalgamation is discussed by the Company.
35.4 Whether the workers can be heard when the scheme is sanctioned by the Court?
This Court has stated in the earlier part of the order when the petition for amalgamation is filed the Court has ordered that
the Company should advertise the matter in two newspapers regarding amalgamation. At this juncture this Court refers to
Rule 25 of the Company (Court) Rules which provides for the contents of advertisement which is general and it provides for
the nature of advertisement which must be in the form of Form No. 5. When such type of advertisement has been published
in the newspaper any person including the worker has right to object to the amalgamation.
35.5 In view of this when the scheme is presented before this Court by virtue of the advertisement, any person including worker
has right to be heard and in fact the workers have objected to the scheme before this Court. The transferor Company has
not objected to the same and therefore this Court is of the view the workers have right to object against sanctioning of the
scheme by the Court. The learned sr. counsel has relied on several judgements in connection with public interest which I
am going to discuss while considering the question of public interest. Those judgements also support his submission that
the workers have right to be heard when the scheme is sanctioned by this Court. It is no doubt true that learned sr. counsel
has pressed into service the judgement of National Textile Workers’ Union vs. Ramkrishnan reported in AIR 1983 SC 75
but the said decision was in connection with winding up of the Company where the workers’ right is completely lost, so in
that context the Hon’ble Supreme Court has held that the workers have right to be heard in winding up petitions particularly
Court passes any order regarding winding up of the Companies. In this case the workers’ right are not lost totally. Only their
rights have been altered and therefore the said decision may not help the ld. sr. counsel. However, the decision definitely
helps the case of workers regarding public interest and therefore not only on provisions of Rule 24 and Rule 25 but even
on the question of public interest the workers have right to be heard.
WORKERS RIGHTS IN CONNECTION WITH ARTICLE 43A OF THE CONSTITUTION:
36.1 Article 43A has been introduced by the Constitution (Forty Second Amendment) Act, 1976 with effect from 3.1.1977.
The importance of Article 43A has been referred to by the Hon’ble Apex Court in the case of National Textile Workers
Union Vs. P.R. Ramakrishnan reported in AIR 1983 SC 75 where the Hon’ble Supreme Court has held that in view of
the Preamble, the directive principles of State Policy and particularly, the introduction of Article 43A, it is idle to contend
that the workers have no voice in proceedings for winding up of a company. Workers of a company and their trade
Unions have the locus standi to appear and be heard. The Hon’ble Supreme Court in the case of Navnit R. Kamani
Vs. R.R. Kamani reported in (1988) 4 SCC 387 endorsed for the first time in that case a scheme for the running of the
company by workers which had been approved by the Board of Industrial and Financial Reconstruction. The Hon’ble
Supreme Court in the case of All India Bank Officers Confederation Vs. Union of India reported in (1989) 4 SCC 90
considered the Circular permitting the Government to disregard the recommendation of the representative union for
appointment to the Board of Directors of a nationalized bank and held that to be ultra vires Article 43A of the Constitution.
All these cases show that Article 43A has very important role to play and as far as this case is concerned, in view of Article
43A and all these decisions, the workers have rights to be heard and in fact they have been heard by this Court at the time
of sanctioning of the scheme of amalgamation.
36.2 Section 25FF of the Industrial Disputes Act provides for rights of the workers of the transferor company. Their consent to
the transfer is not necessary. They have even no right to demand their absorption in the transferee company. If the new
employer is not prepared to protect the existing service conditions and continuity of service, the only right of the employees
of the transferor company is as specified in Section 25FF(1) of the Industrial Disputes Act. Indisputably, in Clause 8 of the
Scheme, a provision has been made for protection of the service conditions and continuity of service, and therefore, there
is no “deemed retrenchment” of the workmen. Section 25FF of the Industrial Disputes Act, which provides for transfer of
ownership or management of an undertaking does not provide that even in case where transferee employer protects the
service conditions and continuity of service and a workman still desires not to join the service of the transferee employer,
such workmen should be entitled to anything more than what an employee gets on voluntary relinquishment of his service.
In absence of such statutory or legal right and none has been pointed out, the question of making any such provision in
the Scheme does not arise. In fact, Section 25FF has been enacted to avoid termination of service which would result on
transfer of undertaking and for the benefit of the workmen.
36.3 The learned sr. counsel, has relied on Section 3A, 3B of the Industrial Disputes Act where provision of Joint Management
Council and functions of the Council has been provided. I see considerable force in the submission of the learned sr. counsel
because by similar Sections 53A and 53B as amended by Bombay Industrial Relations (Gujarat Amendment) Act along
with Rules the State Government introduced Labour Management participation scheme. The intention of the Legislature is
to assist the management to run in efficient, orderly and economic manner. The said provision was challenged before this
Court and the Division Bench of this Court (Coram: J.B. Mehta and A.D. Desai, JJ (as they were then) ) in the matter of
MONOGRAM MILLS LTD., AHMEDABAD & ANR. VS. STATE OF GUJARAT reported in (1976) 17 GLR p. 265 has held
that Sections 53A and 53B do not suffer from vice of excessive delegation and labour disputes and labour welfare fall in the
State list - Labour participation in management of controlled Industries would not change its nature. Such measure would
remain labour welfare measure and, therefore, State Legislature is competent to pass such legislation.
REGARDING CLAUSE 8:
36.4 During the course of his arguments, Mr.K.S.Nanavati, learned Senior Counsel who appeared on behalf of the petitioner
Company clarified that there is no compulsion under the Scheme on the workers to join the new employment. It has
been pointed out that relief in para 28(e) of the petition is intended to ensure that there is a continuity of service. Existing
employees have an option not to join the service of the transferee company and leave the service and therefore the
provision that if the relief as prayed for in para 28(e) is granted, the existing workforce will forcibly have to join the service
of the transferee company is misplaced.
163
36.5 Clause 8 of the Scheme does not foreclose this right of the workmen in any manner. What Clause 8 of the Scheme provides
is that “by virtue” of the Scheme, the employees of the transferor company shall not be entitled to the employment policies
or any schemes or benefits that may be applicable and available to the employees of the Transferee Company. This does
not obviously take away the rights of the employees on becoming the employees of the transferee company to raise such
demands or disputes or claim benefits on whatever ground that may be permissible under the law, as the employees of the
Transferee Company. Such demands if raised, would be adjudicated by the authorities under the Industrial Law. However,
the transferee Company will not object solely on the ground that they are employees of IPCL and not RIL. The present
scheme does not and cannot take away the statutory rights of the workmen under the Industrial Law.
36.6 Thereafter, I considered the relevant decisions in connection with the aforesaid aspect. This Court discussed the judgment
in the case of Hindustan Lever Employees Union vs. Hindustan Lever Limited and another reported in 1995(83)
Company Cases 30 particularly on page 64 the Court has observed like this:
“Next it was urged on behalf of the employees of TOMCO that the scheme will adversely affect them. This argument is not
understandable. The scheme has fully safeguarded the interest of the employees by providing that the terms and conditions
of their service will be continuous and uninterrupted and their service conditions will not be prejudicially affected by reason
of the scheme. The grievance made, however, is that there is no job security of the workers, after the amalgamation of the
two companies. It has been argued that there should have been a clause in amalgamation of the two companies. There
was no assurance on behalf of the TOMCO that the workers will never be retrenched. In fact, the performance of TOMCO
over the last three years was alarming for the workers. It cannot be said that after the amalgamation they will be in a worse
position than they were before the amalgamation.
We do not find that the amalgamation has caused any prejudice to the workers of TOMCO. The stand of the employees
of HLL is equally incomprehensible. It has been stated that if the TOMCO employees continue to enjoy the terms and
conditions of their service as before, then two classes of employees will come into existence. The terms and conditions of
HLL employees were much worse than those of TOMCO employees. If these are two sets of terms and conditions under
the same company, then a case of discrimination will arise against the HLL employees.
We do not find any substance in this contention. The TOMCO employees will continue to remain on the same terms and
conditions as before. Because of this arrangement, it cannot be said that prejudice has been caused to HLL employees.
They will still be getting what they were getting earlier. TOMCO employees who were working under better terms and
conditions, will continue to enjoy their old service conditions under the new management.
Fear has been expressed both by TOMCO employees as well as HLL employees that the results of the amalgamation
would necessitate streamlining of the operations of the enlarged company and the workers will be prejudiced by it.
No one can envisage what will happen in the long run. But on this hypothetical question, the scheme cannot be rejected.
As of now, it has not been shown how the workers are prejudiced by the scheme (Emphasis added).”
36.7 This Court refers to and relies upon the judgment of the Hon’ble Supreme Court in the case of AIR 1961 SC 627 (Jeshtamani
Gulabrai Dholakia and ors. v. Scindia Steam Navigation Co., Bombay...), and particularly, para 10 on page 630, which
reads as under:
“para 10 - We are of opinion that there is no force in any of these contentions. Sec. 20(1) lays down that every officer or
employee of the “existing air companies” employed by them prior to the first day of July of 1952 and still in their employment
immediately before the appointed day shall become as from the appointed day an officer or employee, as the case may be,
of the Corporation in which the undertakings are vested. The object of this provision was to ensure continuity of service to
the employees of the “existing air companies” which were being taken over by the Corporation and was thus for the benefit
of the officers and employees concerned. It is further provided in S. 20(1) that the terms of service etc. would be the same
until they are duly altered by the Corporation .....Further there was no compulsion on the employees or the officers of the
“existing air companies” to serve the Corporation if they did not want to do so. The proviso laid down that any officer or other
employee who did not want to go into the service of the Corporation could get out of service by notice in writing given to the
Corporation before the date fixed, which was in this case July 10, 1953. Therefore, even if the argument of Mr. Chatterjee
that the contract of service between the appellants and their employers had been transferred or assigned by this section
and that this could not be done, be correct, it loses all its force, for the proviso made it clear that any one who did not want
to join the Corporation, was free not to do so, after giving notice up to a certain date.”
36.8 After referring to the judgement in the case of Nokes v. Doncaster Amalgamated Collieries Ltd., 1940 AC 1014 the Hon’ble
Supreme Court has further observed as under:
“This observation itself shows that a contract of service may be transferred by a statutory provision; but in the present case,
as we have already said, there was no compulsory transfer of the contract of service between transfer of the contract of
service between the “existing air companies” and their officers and employees to the Corporation for each of them was
given the option not to join the Corporation, if he gave notice to that effect. The provision of S. 20(1) read with the proviso
is a perfectly reasonable provision and, as a matter of fact, in the interest of employees themselves.”
36.9 This Court also relies upon the judgement of this Court in the case of Gujarat Nylons Limited vs. Gujarat State Fertilizers
Co. Ltd., reported in 1992(1) GLH 637 (Per: C.K.Thakker,J.)(as he was then). In para 27 the learned Judge has
observed as under:
“I have heard Mr. K. S. Zaveri, the learned Counsel appearing for the employees of the transferor Company at length.
However, I do not find any substance in any of the contentions raised by him. In my opinion, conjoint reading of Sections
391 and 394 of the Act make it amply clear that the workmen of the Transferor Company have no legal or statutory right of
holding meeting and to express their opinion on the question of amalgamation. There is no statutory provision to that effect.
No judgment has been shown to me wherein such a view has been taken by the Court that a meeting of the workmen is a
condition precedent in the proceeding of amalgamation of scheme under Section 394 of the Act (Emphasis added).”
36.10 The learned Judge in Gujarat Nylon’s case (supra) has also relied upon the judgment of National Textile Workers’ Union
vs. Ramkrishnan reported in AIR 1983 SC 75. The Hon’ble Supreme Court in NTC case has held that so far as winding
up petition is concerned, the workers had locus standi. In para 30 this Court has observed like this:
164
“In my opinion, however, the said judgment (i.e. NCT’s case)is not helpful to Mr.Zaveri since it cannot apply to the facts of the
case on hand. As stated by me earlier, the statute does not empower or authorise the employees to object amalgamation.
It also does not provide that workmen must be a party to the amalgamation proceedings. It is on the basis of the extended
principles of natural justice that in certain circumstances, courts have interpreted certain provisions granting locus to a
class of persons who are likely to be adversely affected thereby. Again, in my view, Mr. Raval appears to be right when he
submits that at the most from the observations made in Mr. P.R. Ramkrishnan’s case (i.e. NTC case) (supra), it can be said
that even the workmen of the Transferor Company have locus to express their view in this Court when the proceedings
under Sections 391 and 394 are pending. He has submitted that in the instant case, that has been done. They have
appeared through their Counsel and they are heard by this Court and the transferee Company had not taken any objection
against the locus standi of the employees of the transferor Company. It is, however, not necessary that a meeting of the
workers is a condition precedent before a scheme of amalgamation is submitted and that if such a meeting is not held, the
petition of amalgamation is not maintainable at law. Mr. Raval also appears to be right in submitting that when this Court
has in fact heard the objections raised on behalf of the workmen of the transferor Company, the principles of natural justice
have been complied with (Emphasis added).”
36.11 In that case on behalf of workers reliance was placed in the judgment of Nokes vs. Doncaster Amalgamated Collieries
Limited reported in 11 Company Cases 83 and also judgment of Hon’ble Apex Court in the case of Jawaharlal Nehru
University vs. K.S.Jawatkar reported in AIR 1989 SC 1577. After referring to the said judgments, the learned Judge in
paras 33 and 36 has observed as under:
“Almost an identical question arose in the case of Jeshtamini Gulabrai Dholakia v. Schindia Steam Navigation Co., reported
in 1961 SC p.627. In that case, under the provisions of Section 20 of the Air Corporations Act, 1953, an order of transfer of
contract of services of employees of the existing company to the corporation was passed and an option was granted to any
officer or other employees who did not want to join the services of the Corporation, to get out of service by giving notice in
writing to the corporation before the prescribed date. The Supreme Court held that if the employees of the existing company
fail to exercise option given to them under the proviso to Section 20(1) of the Act, they would be governed by provisions
of Section 20(1) of the said Act thereby becoming employees of the new company. I am in respectful agreement with the
view expressed by the Supreme Court in Jeshtamini’s case (supra). The underlying object of such a provision is that no
one can compel an employee to serve with a particular employer against his wish. Therefore, it may happen that though
particular employee may be willing to serve the transferee Company, i.e. GSFC. But such an objection can only be raised
if such employee or a class of employees of the transferor Company are compelled to work with the transferee Company.
If they are not compelled to join the transferee Company, in my opinion, they cannot have any grievance on the scores that
such an auction was taken or an order was passed behind their back or without their consent, since even after the action
or order they are at liberty not to join the transferee Company.” (Emphasis added)
“Mr. Zaveri further contended that if there is amalgamation of transferor Company with the Transferee Company and if the
workmen of the transferor Company are deemed to be workers of the transferee Company with effect from a particular date,
all the workmen can be said to be only of one company, i.e. Transferee Company from that date. They cannot, therefore,
be treated unequally, and there should not be any discrimination between the workers similarly situated. Mr. Raval, on the
other hand, has submitted that this is not a question which can be agitated, dealt with or decided in the present proceedings
by the company court. In amalgamation proceedings, interests of the workmen are required to be protected at the time
of amalgamation as held by Division Bench of this Court in Jitendra Sukhadia v. Alembic Chemical Works Co. reported
in 64 Company Cases 206. He also submitted that the classification can always be made on the basis of geographical
situation of the Unit, educational qualifications of the workmen, nature of work to be performed by the employees, and the
like. The Company Judge in the exercise of powers under Sections 391 and 394 of the Act is not concerned with all these
matters. It is always open to the workers of the Company if they feel aggrieved by any action of the Company to raise a
demand, dispute or claim in an appropriate proceeding. On the ground of potential liability, sanction cannot be refused.
In this connection, Mr. Raval drew my attention to the decision of the Supreme Court in the case of Union of India v.
Alembic Sarabhai Enterprise, reported in 55 Company Cases 623 and of the Karnataka High Court in the case of Mysore
Electrical Works Ltd. v. I.T.O., Bangalore, reported in 52 Company Cases 32. In the latter case, it was specifically held
by the High Court of Karnataka that the direction by the Company Court cannot relate to matters outside the scheme and
obviously it is so. When the Company Court exercises jurisdiction under the Act, it has to decide the matter in accordance
with the provisions of that Act. It is neither deciding any question nor expressing any opinion on the points which do not
strictly fall within the purview of the Scheme of amalgamation. Therefore, if the employees of the transferee Company feel
aggrieved in connection with payment of wages or other conditions of service, it is always open to them to approach an
appropriate forum in accordance with law and all those questions will be decided in those proceedings. Granting of sanction
of amalgamation of companies by this court would not come in the way of workmen, while deciding the question which may
be raised in those proceedings. Even though this legal position is abundantly clear, Mr. Raval stated that if the employees
of the transferee company feel aggrieved, they can approach an appropriate forum if so advised and those proceedings will
be disposed of in accordance with law by appropriate authorities under the relevant statutes.” (Emphasis added)
36.12 This Court has inquired in the office and this Court has been informed that against the judgment in Gujarat Nylons Limited and
Gujarat State Fertilizers Co. Ltd., in Company Petition Nos.143 and 144 of 1990 decided by this Court (Coram: C.K. Thakker,
J. (as he was then) dated 7.3.1991, O.J. Appeal No. 3/91 was filed by Gujarat Nylons Employees Union and O.J. Appeal
No. 4/91 was also filed by Gujarat Nylons Employees Union through their learned advocate and these two appeals reached
hearing before this Court (Coram: G.N. Ray, CJ. (as he was then) and R.K. Abichandani, J.) and the Division Bench of this
Court disposed of the appeals by order dated 15.3.1991 and confirmed the judgment of learned Single Judge. [However, copy
of the order is not available].
36.13 Similar situation arose in the case of Narmada Chematur Petrochemicals Limited in Company Petition No.147 of 2006 and
other connected matters decided by this Court (Coram: M.R.Shah, J. ) on 9.1.2007. After referring to the aforesaid Gujarat
Nylon’s case (supra) on page 28 the learned Judge has observed like this:
“Thus, considering the decision of this Court in the case of Gujarat Nylons Ltd.,[supra], if there is any disparity of the payscales of employees of two companies or two divisions, post merger, it will be open for the employees of the erstwhile
NCPL to raise industrial dispute under the Labour Laws before the appropriate forum which can be adjudicated by the
appropriate forum after taking appropriate evidence and after hearing all the parties in accordance with law”.
165
36.14 Last contention regarding grievance is that they were not consulted in the process of negotiations and their consent was
not taken to the Scheme of Amalgamation. Reference may be made to AIR 2006 SC 2056 para 10 which reads as follows:
“10. Elaborate arguments were advanced on the question as to whether an employee’s consent is a must under Section
25FF of the Act. The common law rule that an employee cannot be transferred without consent, applies in master - servant
relationship and not to statutory transfers. Though great emphasis was laid by learned counsel for the respondent on
Jawaharlal Nehru University v. Dr.K.S. Jawatkar and others [1989 (supp) 1 SCC 679], a close reading of the judgment
makes it clear that the common law rule was applied. But there is not any specific reference to Section 25FF or its
implication. There is nothing in the wording of Section 25FF even remotely to suggest that consent is a pre-requisite for
transfer. The underlying purpose of Section 25FF is to establish a continuity of service and to secure benefits otherwise
not available to a workman if a break in service to another employer was accepted. Therefore, the letter of consent of the
individual employee cannot be a ground to invalidate the action.”
36.15 Consent of the workers of the transferor company to the Scheme of Merger, therefore is not necessary.
36.16 So far as the rights of the workers subsequent to amalgamation are concerned, it is well settled that it is always open to the
workers to be employees of the transferee company, to raise such demand, to claim such benefit and raise such disputes
as may be permissible under the Industrial Law.
36.17 So far as Rule 8 is concerned, the learned sr. counsel has made very forceful submissions. However, once this Court holds
that so far as previous employees of IPCL are concerned, even after merger, their rights and interest are to be protected
by the transferee Company and their conditions of service have not to be prejudicially affected by the transferee Company.
Once this Court has directed that the same is in consonance with the judgement of the Hon’ble Supreme Court in the case
of Hindustan Lever Limited (supra), the contention of the learned sr. counsel that clause 8 of the scheme of amalgamation
be struck down cannot be accepted.
36.18 So far as clause 8 regarding compulsion is concerned, this Court has already observed that as per the concession given
by the learned counsel for the transferee company that all the employees of the transferor company will be given an option
of two months either to join or not to join with the transferee company. If they desire they can exercise their option. If they
do not want to join the transferee Company, they may not join the transferee company. This clause of option is given only
with a view to mitigate the hardship of the employees so they may not be compulsorily transferred to transferee company.
36.19 As regards future rights are concerned, it is no doubt clear that clause 8 has provided all the previous employees of IPCL
who exercise the option and decide to join the transferee company by clause 8 which provides that they are not entitled
to the benefits of the transferee company. However, this has been stated because they are allowed to enjoy whatever the
benefits they were enjoying by the transferee company. However, this Court hopes and trusts that in future if the employees
raise any demand after forgoing their benefits which they were enjoying from the transferor company against the transferee
company, this Court hopes and trusts the transferee company will consider their demands. If it is referred to Industrial Court
for adjudication, the concerned Court will consider the same.
36.20 If one sees the Financial Highlights - 10 years at a Glance for the periods 1996-97 to 2005-2006 which is a part of this judgement
at Annexure-A it shows that in 1996-97 there were 13,013 employees whereas in 2001-2002 there were 13,740 employees
and in 2005-2006 there are 14,274 employees. Now as contended by the learned sr. counsel Mr. Patel all the three unions
have 5000 employees who oppose the scheme of amalgamation. So if one considers that out of 14,274 employees, 5000
employees are opposing the scheme, so at least more than 50% employees are not opposing the scheme and they are
supporting the scheme. This is also one of the factors which this Court has considered for sanctioning the scheme.
RE: PUBLIC INTEREST & PUBLIC POLICY:
37.1 This Court has considered the submissions of learned counsel for the applicant and the company. Once the company
merges, all particular items of assets and liabilities also get merged. The contention of applicant that Transferee Company
has decided to misuse or wipe out the Transferor Company is baseless and without any substance. There is no material
produced in this behalf. The contention that the Transferee Company desires to misutilize the assets of the Transferor
Company is also baseless and without any substance. In this behalf I rely upon the judgment of Delhi High Court in the
case of In Re. HCL Infosystems Limited, HCL Infinet Limited and HCL Technologies Limited (2004) Comp. Case 861 (Del),
wherein the scheme of arrangement was challenged on the ground that the company is siphoning away the profitable
business. The objector referred to a TV interview in this regard. It was held in para 31 that, “... Since in the present case
the overwhelming majority of the shareholders has approved the scheme, the same cannot override the opinion of the
intervener. The allegation of the objector that there is an effort to siphoning of the profitable business of the company in
which case the minority shareholders would be deprived of the benefit is also considered by me giving due weightage
thereto. No basis is provided in support of the aforesaid allegation. Therefore, the aforesaid contention is also without any
merit”.
37.2 If one examines the amalgamation scheme then it reveals that all the desired disclosures have been made in the Scheme.
The rationale benefits of the Scheme have been dealt with in the Scheme itself. The Petitioner Company has already
presented the Scheme with requisite details. It also shows that the scheme is beneficial not only to the Transferor Company
and Transferee Company but also to the community at large. Once two companies get amalgamated, naturally the cost of
the item will be less and company will be able to save certain administrative expenses. This is in the public interest.
37.3 As far as Official Liquidator is concerned, he had appointed one M/s.Malay J. Dalal, Chartered Accountants for carrying out
the investigation work, and in their report, the Chartered Accountants after scrutiny of the Books of Accounts and affairs
of the transferor company have submitted investigation report dated 4.6.2007. The said report contains brief history and
activities of IPCL, objects of IPCL, activities of the company, management. The report ends with this observation that, as
per the record made available to them i.e. Chartered Accountants, and as per the information and explanations provided to
them (Chartered Accountants), there is no material litigation either against the Directors of IPCL or against the Company
and there is no prosecution against them either under the Companies Act or any other law for the time being in force in
connection with the business and operation of the company.
166
37.4 The report also speaks about the accounts and financial position of the company, and under the said head, the Chartered
Accountants have also stated about the Fixed Assets, Leased Assets, Depreciation, Impairment of Assets, Foreign Currency
Transactions, Investments, Inventories, Turnover, Excise Duty, Employees Retirement Benefits, Borrowing Costs, Financial
Derivatives, Provision for Current and Deferred Tax, Notes on Accounts. Even Internal Audit, Tax Audit, Income-Tax, Sales
Tax, Excise Duty, Profession Tax, Provident Fund / Superannuation /Gratuity/ ESIC, Contingent Liability, Summarised
Financial Position, Summarised Profit and Loss Account, Summarised Balance Sheet, Maintenance of Books of Accounts
and Statutory Records, Maintenance of Cost Records and Credit Facilities. The Chartered Accountants have also shown
the details of Transferee Company. The Chartered Accountants have also taken into consideration the advantages of
amalgamation, salient features of the Scheme of amalgamation, Inter-se Transactions, Legal Proceedings, Conduct of
Business, Employees, Saving of concluded transactions, Issue of Equity Shares, Issue of New GDRs, Fractional GDRs,
General Provisions, Exemption from Registration, Accounting Treatment, Declaration of dividends, validity of existing
Resolutions, Modifications in the Scheme, Scheme conditional upon sanction, costs and in conclusion it has been stated
that on the basis of their comments in above paras and according to the explanations given to them and the books of
accounts produced before them, the acts and transactions of IPCL were conducted within the objects mentioned in the
Memorandum of Association of Company and its affairs of the Company have not been conducted in a manner prejudicial
to the interest of its members or the public interest.
37.5 The objectors have not been able to show any material whatsoever as to how the scheme is against the public interest and
public policy. When the policy question of the Government particularly disinvestment policy or policy of the Companies Act
regarding amalgamation is concerned, the Court jurisdiction is extremely limited. In this behalf this Court relies upon the
judgment of Hon’ble Apex Court in the case of Balco Employees Union (Regd.) vs. Union of India, (2002) 108 Comp. Cases
193 (SC), page 236 where it has stated that: “Wisdom and advisability of economic policies are ordinarily not amenable to
judicial review unless it can be demonstrated that the policy is contrary to any statutory provision or the Constitution. It is
not for the Court to consider relative merits of different economic policies and consider whether a wiser or a better one can
be evolved. For testing the correctness of a policy, the appropriate forum is Parliament and not the Courts. In the matter
of policy decision of economic matters, the Courts should be very circumspect in conducting any enquiry or investigation
and must be reluctant to impugn the judgements of the experts who may have arrived at a conclusion unless the Court
is satisfied that there is illegality in the decision itself. The existence of rights of protection under Articles 14 and 16 of the
Constitution cannot possibly have the effect of vetoing the Government’s right to disinvest. Nor can the employees claim
a right of continuous consultation at different stages of the disinvestment process. If the disinvestment process is gone
through without contravening any law, then the normal consequences as a result of disinvestment must follow.” (Emphasis
added)
37.6 It may be noted that Section 394-A provides notice to be given to Central Government for applications under Secs. 391 and
394. Section 394-A makes it obligatory on the Court to give notice to the Central Government of every application made to
it under Section 391 or 394 and to take into consideration the representations made by that Government before passing
any order on the proposed compromise or arrangement or scheme of amalgamation. This would enable the Government to
study the proposal and raise such objections thereto as it thinks fit in the light of the facts and information available with it,
and also place the Court in possession of certain facts which might not have been disclosed by those who appear before it
so that the interests of the investing public at large may be fully taken into account by the Court before passing its order. In
this matter this Court has issued notice and the Regional Director has filed affidavit that he has no objection in this behalf
and therefore in my view this also covers the aspect of public interest and public policy.
WHAT IS PUBLIC INTEREST - RIGHTS OF WORKERS:
37.7 Now this Court considers various judgements of the Hon’ble Supreme Court and other Courts where what is meant by
public interest has been considered.
37.7(1) FERTILIZER CORPORATION KAMAGAR UNION (REGD.) SINDRI & OTHERS VS. UNION OF INDIA & OTHERS
reported in AIR 1981 SC 344 particularly para 47 on page 356 where the Hon’ble Supreme Court has observed as under:
“In the present case a worker, who clearly, has an interest in the industry brings this action regarding an alleged wrong
doing by the Board of Management. Article 43A of the Constitution confers, in principle, partnership status to workers in
industry and we cannot, therefore, be deterred by technical considerations of corporate personality to keep out those who
seek to remedy wrongs committed in the management of public sector.”
37.7(2) NATIONAL TEXTILE WORKERS’ UNION VS. RAM KRISHNAN reported in AIR 1983 SC 75: where the Hon’ble Apex
Court has observed as under:
“para 4 ...The socio-economic objectives set out in Part IV of the Constitution have since guided and shaped this new
corporate philosophy.”
“para 5. A company, according to the new socio- economic thinking, is a social institution having duties and responsibilities
towards the community in which it functions.”
“para 6. We are concerned in these appeals only with the relationship of the workers vis-a-vis the company. It is clear
from what we have stated above that it is not only the shareholders who have supplied capital who are interested in the
enterprise which is being run by a company but the workers who supply labour are also equally, if not, more interested
because what is produced by the enterprise is the result of labour as well as capital.”
“... Then follows Article 43-A which is intended to herald industrial democracy and in the words of Krishna Iyer, J. mark “the
end of industrial bonded labour”. That Article says that the State shall take steps, by suitable legislation or in any other way,
to secure the participation of workers in the management of undertakings, establishments or other organisations engaged
in any industry.”
37.7(3) HINDUSTAN LEVER EMPLOYEES’ UNION VS. HINDUSTAN LEVER LTD. AND OTHERS reported in 83 Company
Cases 30 where at page 39 the Hon’ble Supreme Court has observed as under:
167
“What requires, however thoughtful consideration, is whether the company court has applied its mind to the public interest
involved in the merger. In this regard the Indian law is a departure from the English law and it enjoins a duty on the court to
examine objectively and carefully if the merger was not violative of public interest. No such provision exists in the English
law. What would be public interest cannot be put in strait-jacket. It is a dynamic concept which keeps on changing. It has
been explained in Black’s Law Dictionary, as “something in which the public, the community at large, has some pecuniary
interest, or some interest by which their legal rights or liabilities are affected. It does not mean anything so narrow as
mere curiosity, whereas the interest of the particular locality which may be affected by the letters in question. Interest
shared by citizens generally in affairs of local, State or National Government”. It is an expression of wide amplitude. It
may have different connotation and understanding when used in service law and yet a different meaning in criminal law or
civil law and its share may be entirely different in company law. Its perspective may change when merger is of two Indian
companies. But when it is with a subsidiary of a foreign company the consideration may be entirely different. It is not the
interest of the shareholders or the employees only but the interest of the society which may have to be examined. And a
scheme valid and good may yet be bad if it is against public interest.
Section 394 casts an obligation on the court to be satisfied that the scheme for amalgamation or merger was not contrary
to public interest. The basic principle of such satisfaction is none other than the broad and general principles inherent
in any compromise or settlement entered into between parties that it should not be unfair or contrary to public policy or
unconscionable. In amalgamation of companies, the courts have evolved, the principle of “prudent business management
test” or that the scheme should not be a device to evade law. But when the Court is concerned with a scheme of merger
with a subsidiary of a foreign company then the test is not only whether the scheme shall result in maximising the profits of
the shareholders or whether the interest of employees was protected but it has to ensure that the merger shall not result
in impeding promotion of industry or obstruct the growth of national economy. Liberalised economic policy is to achieve
this goal. The merger, therefore, should not be contrary to this objective. Reliance on the English decision for Hoare, In
re (1933) All BR 105 (Ch D) and Bugle Press Ltd., In re (1961) Ch 270 that the power of the Court is to be satisfied only
whether the provisions of the Act have been complied with or that the class or classes were fully represented and the
arrangement was such as a man of business would reasonably approve between two private companies may be correct
and may normally be adhered to but when the merger is with a subsidiary of a foreign company then economic interest of
the country may have to be given precedence. The jurisdiction of the court in this regard is comprehensive.”
37.7(4) WOOD POLYMER LIMITED, In Re. AND BENGAL HOTELS PVT. LTD., In Re. Reported in 47 Company Cases 597
relevant page 615 where it is observed as follows:
“The question that should be fairly posed is : whether it is shown that the affairs of the company have not been carried on
in a manner prejudicial to the public interest? What then is the concept of “public interest” in company law. In the heydays
of laissez faire, it was quite well-known for the leaders of trade and industry not only to ignore but disavow public interest
involved in carrying on business. Their sole attention was confined to the interest of creditors and members. But other
important consumers of industry-cum-commercial service were wholly ignored, namely, employees and consumers of the
goods produced by the industry, I mean, the society.”
37.7(5) PANCHMAHALS STEEL LTD. VS. UNIVERSAL STEEL TRADERS reported in 46 Company Cases 706 (Coram: D.A.
Desai, J (as he was then)) particularly at pages 718-719 it is observed thus:
“Law must take note of the existing situation in which problems that arise in law and have a human content have to be
disposed of. Law cannot divorce itself off the mores of the day. Philosophy of law is functional and not analytical. Now, if
law takes note of the existing situation in which a problem has been put in the lap of the Court, a solution must be sought
through the machinery of law. Law cannot be static and its interpretation has to be dynamic. Law cannot operate in vacuum.
Either by its pragmatic approach or progressive interpretation, law must find and offer a solution or it must perish. Socioeconomic problems of the contemporary times cannot be solved by the arid nineteenth century approach to the provisions
of company laws. Time-honoured approach that the company law must safeguard the interest of investors and shareholders
of the company would be too rigid a framework in which it can now operate. New problems call for a fresh approach. And
in ascertaining and devising this fresh approach, the objective for which the company is formed may provide a guideline for
the direction to be taken. As Prof. De Wool of Belgium puts it, the company has a three-fold reality - economic, human and
public each with its own internal logic. The reality of the company is much broader than that of an association of capital; it
is a human working community that performs a collective action for the common good. In recent years a debate is going on
in the world at large on the functions and foundations of corporate enterprise. The ‘preservationists’ and the ‘reformers’ are
vigorously propounding their views on the possible reform of company, the modern trend emphasising the public interest
in corporate enterprise. And what is the modern trend? Prof. Gower in his “The Principles of Modern Company Law”, third
edition, at page 634, had dealt with this problem in its true perspective and it is worth quoting:
‘One section of the community whose interests as such are not afforded any protection, either under this head or by virtue
of the provisions for investor or creditor protection, are the workers and employees of the taken-over company. This is a
particularly unfortunate facet of the principle that the interest of the company means only the interest of the members and
not of those whose livelihood is in practice much more closely involved.’
In the same book in Chapter “The Future of Company Law in a Mixed Economy”, the same author has pointedly drawn
attention to the reversal of priority as a future modification of the company law and it bears the quotation (page 62).
‘The vexed question of the relationship between the employees and the company which employs them is, in fact, a dominant
theme in the current debate which flows over from company to labour law. It is generally accepted that it is unreal for the
company law to ignore, as at present our law largely does, that the workers are as much, if not more, a part of the company
as members of it”
37.7(6) In re HATHISING MANUFACTURING COMPANY LTD. (IN LIQUIDATION) reported in 46 Company Cases 59 particularly
at pages 79-80 where this Court has observed thus:
“The third criteria is whether the scheme of compromise and arrangement is such as a man of business would reasonably
approve. The position can be examined in the wider context and not in the narrower context of the interest adversely
affected by the scheme. Today, in our country, the corporate sector of economy has to play vital role both for phased
168
expansion of the economic growth rate which can only be brought about by production and higher production, and the
corresponding obligation to provide job avenues is of equal importance. It is the upward trend in growth resulting in higher
economic growth rate which will provide expanded job avenues. And these are the twin objects visualised in the world of
economic planning. One cannot push up the living standard of those living below starvation line, unless some job is offered
to them. Expansion of job avenues is the need of the day and this can keep pace with the economic growth rate, provided
production is pushed up.”xxxxxxxxxx but an honest businessman with genuine commercial judgement can feel very happy
as to how by judicial process and legal contrivance a dead unit of production can be revived, revitalised and resurructed.
That is our attempt and if one can avoid scrapping machine by profit-oriented businessman, the scheme must go through.
I would, therefore, say that this is a scheme of compromise and arrangement which must appeal to a businessman of the
type herein discussed and that should be the approach of the Court.”
37.7(7) GUJARAT KAMDAR SAHAKARI MANDAL AND OTHERS VS. RAMKRISHNA MILLS LTD. (92 Company Cases 92) at
page Nos. 710-711 where this Court has observed as under:
“(viii) .....The way and the manner in which the industry is to be run is yet to be discussed and deliberated upon and at this
stage the scheme cannot be turned down by this Court on the ground that the applicant is lacking experience to run the
textile mill. Even otherwise, the workers’ scheme for running the sick unit or worker’ co- operative coming forward with a
scheme to restart the sick unit is a step towards fulfilment of one of the Directive Principles of State Policy which came to
be introduced by the 42nd Amendment in the Constitution. Article 43A provides that the State shall take steps by suitable
legislation or in any way to secure the participation of workers in the management of undertakings, establishments or
other organisations engaged in any industry. This constitutional mandate has found executive asset as it is reported that
the Minister of State for Labour has on behalf of the Government of India informed the Rajya Sabha that it was willing
to hand over the sick industrial units to employees’ co-operatives for their revival and that it would provide all possible
encouragements. It is also reported that the Finance Ministry had even indicated that it could consider writing off liabilities
of the sick units if they were taken over by the employees’ co-operatives. Even the Board for Industrial and Financial
Reconstruction has sanctioned four schemes for revival of sick industries through workers’ co-operatives, one of terms and
conditions of the proposed scheme inter alia stipulates that secured creditors (financial institutions) shall waive their dues
as per the policy of the Government of India.”
37.7(8) LARSEN AND TOUBRO LIMITED reported in 121 Com. Cases 523 (Bom.) where at page 571 it is observed as under:
“The public interest, in sanctioning of the scheme of any kind, cannot be decided merely on the basis of general allegations
of fraud, illegality or breach of public policy or public interest. There is no material placed on the record to justify the
allegations of breach of public policy or public interest or that the scheme is unfair and contrary to the laws. After perusal of
the scheme and after hearing all counsel for the respective companies and after considering the objections filed on record,
there is nothing to show that the present scheme is against public interest or public policy. The corporate purpose and
object of the scheme of arrangement as a whole is fair, just and reasonable on all material aspects.”
MEANING OF PUBLIC INTEREST:
37.8 The expression is ‘an elusive abstraction’ meaning general social welfare or ‘regard for social good’ and predicating ‘interest
of the general public in matters where regard for the social good is of the first moment’. {See. Public Administration and the
Public Interest by E.Pendleton Herring}.
37.9 A thing is said to be in the public interest where it is or can be made to appear to be contributive to the general welfare rather
than to the special privileges of a class, group or individual. DICTIONARY OF SOCIOLOGY, para 161.
37.10 It is essentially a majoritarian ethic measured rather in terms of results or consequences than of interest or motive. Any
decision as to public interest should be based on the results or consequences that will follow.
37.11 In common parlance it is taken to mean the interest of the community or nation as a whole as also the State or Government
which represents it.
{Re: Companies Act by A. Ramaiya, Sixteenth Edition 2004 particularly page 3363 and 3364}.
37.12 The learned counsel has relied on page 37 of Hindustan Lever Employees Union’s case (supra) regarding jurisdiction of
the Court, fairness of the scheme which is already referred to earlier and page 39 regarding public interest which is also
referred to earlier.
37.13 All the above cases show the importance of public interest. It is no doubt true that in the Scheme of amalgamation the Court
has to see public interest. However, the objectors have not been able to show as to how the scheme of amalgamation is
against the public interest or public policy.
RE. MONOPOLY:
38. It is no doubt true that the IPCL was originally a public limited company run by Central Government, but from 2002 when disinvestment
policy came about 26% shares of IPCL were purchased by Reliance Industries Limited. The said fact has already been divulged by
the Transferor Company. The US Guidelines of Department of Justice, as relied upon by the learned advocates for the objectors
are not relevant in the present amalgamation proceedings. There is no statutory requirement restricting amalgamation of associate
company with the parent company under anti-trust laws in India. In this behalf both Regional Director and the Official Liquidator
being statutory authorities, after examining this Scheme and all relevant correspondence and documents called for by them from
the Petitioner Company, were fully satisfied with the Scheme and certified to the Court that the Scheme was not against the public
policy and that the affairs of the Petitioner Company have not been conducted in a manner prejudicial to interest of the members
or to public interest.
38.1 In addition, both Bombay Stock Exchange Limited and National Stock Exchange of India Limited have approved the
Scheme under Clause 24(f) of the Listing Agreement. In this behalf I rely upon the judgment of Hon’ble Apex Court in the
case of Hindustan Lever Limited, (1995) 83 Company Cases 30, page 65, para F to G as well as judgment of this Court
in Reliance Petroleum Limited vs. Union of India (2002) (O) GLHEL 210579, para 17, “One more objection is to the effect
that the Court should refuse to grant its approval to the Scheme on the ground of public interest as the amalgamation will
169
result in creation of monopoly in relation to production and marketing of goods. Nothing has been shown under any Act,
Rule or Regulation or any other law under which the Company Court cannot exercise jurisdiction to sanction a Scheme in
the event of a possibility or likelihood of monopoly resulting on the Scheme being sanctioned. The Apex Court has stated
time and again that it is for the shareholders to decide what is in the best interest of the Company and if the shareholders
have arrived at such a decision by applying approach of a prudent businessmen, it is not for Court to sit in judgment.
Furthermore, nothing has been brought on record to show that even if a monopoly results, it would affect the public interest
or the economic interest of the country adversely, which may be a factor having relevant bearing.” (Emphasis added)
38.2 In this behalf, This Court states that the Monopolies and Restrictive Trade Practices Act which was originally aimed to
prevent monopoly has been repealed by the Parliament. Therefore, Therefore, the Parliament has enacted the Competition
Act, 2002 which provides for keeping in view the economic development of the country, for the establishment of a
Commission to prevent practices having adverse effect on competition, to promote and sustain competition in markets, to
protect the interests of consumers and to ensure freedom of trade carried on by other participants in markets, in India, and
for matters connected therewith or incidental thereto.
38.3 When the Competition Act was enacted, one of the statements of objects and reasons of the Competition Act, was as
follows:
“In the pursuit of globalisation, India has responded by opening up its economy, removing controls and resorting to
liberalisation. The natural corollary of this is that the Indian market should be geared to face competition from within the
country and outside. The Monopolies and Restrictive Trade Practices Act, 1969 has become obsolete in certain respects in
the light of international economic developments relating more particularly to competition laws and there is a need to shift
our focus from curbing monopolies to promoting competition.”
38.4 In view of the above situation when the entire Monopolies and Restrictive Trade Practices Act is repealed and new
Competitive Act is enacted and in view of the objects and reasons of the Competitive Act, the entire question of of monopoly
has no relevance. If one takes judicial notice of the fact that even the Government has also merged Air India with Indian
Airlines to achieve the economy scale.
OBSERVATIONS RE.: DOCTRINE OF LIFTING OF VEIL OF CORPORATE PERSONALITY.
39.1 The doctrine of ‘lifting the veil of corporate personality’ is the one that is concerned with looking behind that juristic person
called the ‘corporation’.
39.2 Broadly speaking, the corporate veil may be lifted where the statute itself contemplates lifting veil, or fraud or improper
conduct is intended to be prevented, or a taxing statute or a beneficent statute is sought to be evaded.
39.3 So if there is any ulterior motive for amalgamation then one can lift the veil. Here there is no whisper about the same and
there is no question of lifting the veil. This contention is not well founded.
HIDDEN ASPECT:
40. As regards hidden aspect, both the companies have shown their balance sheets, public notice has been issued. Official liquidator
has also filed report. The Regional Director has also filed report. Considering all these aspects, in my view the contention of hidden
objects which is being contended is not right.
OBSERVATION REGARDING SHARE EXCHANGE RATIO AND VALUATION REPORT:
41.1 This Court has considered the rival submissions in the above connection. The first contention that the objectors were not
given share exchange ratio is not tenable because in fact the Official Liquidator has filed his report and along with affidavit
of Official Liquidator, the report of auditors who are appointed by IPCL namely Pricewaterhouse Coopers Private Limited
and Ernst & Young Private Limited dated 9.3.2007 has been produced. The same shows the share exchange ratio.
41.2 It may be noted that the above share exchange ratio report is only for the guidance and assistance of the Board of Directors
of companies to propose a share exchange ratio. The share exchange ratio has been calculated by the two eminent
Chartered Accountants firms. The report shows about the procedure adopted by them. They have relied upon the data
explanation. They have considered the financial position of the transferor company and transferee company. Along with
the report there is further schedule which shows the factors determining share exchange ratio of equity shareholders where
they have considered the financial position of both transferor company and transferee company. They have also stated the
methodology, net assets value, earnings value and market value of the shares. These methods are well- known methods
in share exchange ratio report. Once that is so, the jurisdiction of the Court is very Limited.
41.3 From the facts it has been clear that valuation report was kept open for inspection for all shareholders before the meeting.
Notice convening the meeting of shareholders clearly stated that the report of the valuers regarding share exchange ratio
was available for inspection at least for 21 days before the date of the meeting. In spite of this, none of the Objectors availed
of the opportunity to inspect the same or objected for such inspection, asking for a copy of the report.
41.4 In view of the same, the objectors’ present contention that they had no opportunity to see the valuation report is clearly
an after-thought and without any basis. Once the report of the valuation is annexed with the Official Liquidator Report, the
same is part of record in this behalf.
41.5 The reliance placed by the applicant in Sultania’s case is not relevant in this behalf as that case was pertaining to SEBI
Takeover Regulations, which specifies principles of valuation to be stated in case the shares are infrequently traded. Such
specifications are not at all relevant in the present scheme of amalgamation under Sections 391-394 of the Act. Since it is
not the case of the objectors that the shares of the transferor company are infrequently traded.
41.6 In this behalf this Court relies upon the judgment of Hindustan Lever’s case reported in (1995) 83 Comp. Cases 30, at page
37, para B and C, “... the jurisdiction of the court in sanctioning a claim of merger is not to ascertain with mathematical
accuracy if the determination satisfied the arithmetical test. A Company Court does not exercise an appellate jurisdiction. It
exercises a jurisdiction founded on fairness. It is not required to interfere only because the figures arrived at by the valuer
was not as good as it would have been if another method had been adopted. What is imperative is that such determination
170
should not have been contrary to law and that it was not unfair for the shareholders of the company which was being
merged. The Court’s obligation is to be satisfied that valuation was in accordance with law and it was carried out by an
independent body”. (Emphasis added)
41.7 This Court also refers to page 57 of the above judgement, wherein the Hon’ble Supreme Court has approved the Division
Bench judgment of this Court in the case of Jitendra R.Sukhadia vs. Alembic Chemical Works Ltd., (1987) 3 Comp LJ 141
: (1988) 64 Comp Cases 206, where the Court has observed that how exchange ratio was worked out, however, was not
required to be stated in the statement contemplated under Section 391(a) of the Companies Act.” (Emphasis added). The
contention of the applicant that valuation report in the present case is not as per the specifications is without any substance
and devoid of any merits. Section 391 does not require detailed workings to be shown to shareholders.
41.8 It may be noted that in this case the equity shareholders of the petitioner company have approved the scheme incorporating
the share exchange ratio by an overwhelming majority. Once that is so, the Court jurisdiction is very limited. This Court
relies on the Hon’ble Supreme Court judgment in Miheer H.Mafatlal vs. Mafatlal Industries Ltd. (supra), particularly para 40
which reads as under:
“It has also to be kept in view that which exchange ratio is better is in the realm of commercial decision of well informed
equity shareholders. It is not for the Court to sit in appeal over this value judgment of equity shareholders who are supposed
to be men of world and reasonable persons who know their own benefit and interest underlying any proposed scheme. With
open eyes they have okayed this ratio and the entire scheme.”
41.9 This Court further refers to the judgment of this Court in the case of Reliance Petroleum Ltd., 2002(O) GLHEL 210579
(Company Petition No. 75 of 2002 decided on 13.9.2002 (per D.A. Mehta, J), wherein this Court dealt with identical issues
and in para 27 this Court has held as under:
“para 27. Thus, by an overwhelming majority, those present have voted in favour of the resolution i.e. in favour of
approving the Scheme as per share exchange ratio proposed on the basis of the valuation report dated 3.3.2002. In these
circumstances, it is not open to the Court to hold that there was any impropriety in the valuation of the shares. In fact,
the valuation report has stated that it has based its conclusion of value on the figures of assets and liabilities of both RPL
and RIL reflected in the Balance Sheet as on 31.3.2001 along with the audited financial statement for the year ended on
31.3.1999 and 31.3.2000. The valuation report has also taken into consideration extracts of unaudited financial statements
for the 9 months period ended on 31.12.2001. This is over and above the discussions with the management of both RPL and
RIL, other informations, explanations and representations as were required and provided by the respective managements
along with such other analysis, reviews and inquiries as were found necessary. The valuation report further states that the
valuers have not made any independent investigation and assume no responsibilities for the various informations, details,
explanations and representations placed before the valuers. It was vehemently urged during the course of hearing that this
sort of disclaimer would virtually amount to the valuers denying any responsibility as regards the validity or genuineness
of the share exchange ratio. It is necessary to note that the figure of exchange ratio arrived at by the valuers could not be
shown to be vitiated by fraud and/or mala fide. It is settled legal position that merely because the determination is done by
a slightly different method which might result in a different conclusion would not justify interference unless it was found to be
unfair. There is nothing on record to hold that the exchange ratio, brought on record by the aforesaid valuation report, is in
any manner unjust or unfair. At the cost of repetition, it requires to be stated that it is the commercial wisdom of the parties
to the Scheme who have taken an informed decision about the usefulness and propriety of the Scheme by supporting it by
the requisite majority vote that has to to be kept in view by the Court. The Court has neither the expertise nor the jurisdiction
to delve deep into the commercial wisdom exercised by the creditors and members of the company who have ratified the
Scheme by the requisite majority”.
41.10 The learned sr. Counsel for the objectors has relied upon the judgment of Miheer Mafatlal’s case (supra) but the same is
not relevant in this behalf. In fact the Hon’ble Supreme Court has not pointed out that the details of the working for arriving
at the share exchange ratio have to be covered in the valuation report, and therefore the contention of the Objectors that
the valuation report is contrary to Section 391(2) of the Companies Act is without any merit and baseless.
41.11 As regards valuation not as per HLL/ TOMCO Case, it is no doubt true that the Hon’ble Supreme Court has referred to the
principle specified by ‘Weinberg and Blank’ in the book ‘Takeovers and Mergers’, but that was only recommendatory or
illustrative in nature. It is not that if the same is not followed, the report of share exchange ratio becomes bad. In the present
case the valuers have taken into account the relevant factors and methods as set out in the valuation report to arrive at the
share exchange ratio and as such the same is very relevant, legal and valid.
41.12 The contention that valuation report is not as per FEMA regulations/CCI Guidelines is also not well-founded. The Objectors
have failed to show as to which FEMA regulations are applicable for arriving at share exchange ratio in relation to
amalgamation under Sections 391-394 of the Act. Further, CCI (Controller of Capital Issues) guidelines have already been
repealed way back in the year 1992 and therefore there is no question of referring the said guidelines in this behalf.
41.13 In view of these facts and circumstances of the case, there is no basis for the objection regarding share exchange ratio and
valuation report and the said contention cannot be accepted in this behalf.
41.14 In the above case, the share exchange ratio, which was worked out by a recognized firm of Chartered Accountants, was
accepted by the shareholders and no mistake was pointed out in the process of valuation. The Court refused to interfere in
this aspect of the scheme. This Court also relies upn the case of NAVJIVAN MILLS LTD. Re: (1972) 42 Com. Cases 265
at p. 320 (Guj).
41.15 As regards share exchange ratio, it was submitted that though the appointed date in the Scheme is 1st April, 2006, for the
purpose of valuation, the auditor has not considered the said date. The Company has submitted that the appointed date in
the scheme is 1st April, 2006. For the purpose of valuation, the valuers have analyzed and considered the audited financial
statements of RIL and IPCL for the three years ending on 31st March, 2006. It is, therefore, that the appointed date in the
scheme is fixed as 1st April, 2006.
171
OBSERVATION REGARDING DEBENTURE HOLDERS ARE SEPARATE CLASS FROM THE SECURED CREDITORS.
42.1 This Court has considered the objections filed by Mr. Shalin Mehta, learned advocate in this behalf.
42.2 The contention of the applicant that Debenture Holders are separate class and distinct from Secured Creditors of IPCL on
the basis of the provisions of Section 117A of the Companies Act which provides for Debenture Trust Deed; Section 117B
which provides for appointment of Debenture Trustee and duties of Debenture Trustees and Section 117C which provides
for liability of Company to create Security and debenture redemption reserves. The issue is that debenture holders are to
some extent separately treated by Company Law from the secured creditors. It is also no doubt that Articles of Association
also treat debenture holders differently from secured creditors. Even the balance sheet of IPCL also treats debenture
holders separately from secured creditors. Therefore, there is considerable force in the submission of Mr. Mehta, learned
advocate in this behalf.
42.3 However, the debenture holders are also a part of the secured creditors. The contention of the applicant that debenture
holders of IPCL and secured creditors of IPCL have dissimilar charges over the Company’s assets is not borne out from
the record of the case. The concept of ‘preferential creditors’ is not relevant in the context of amalgamation. Section
530 of the Companies Act lists out different categories of preferential creditors such as Government revenues, wages of
workmen, provident fund, pension fund, gratuity fund and so on. Debenture holders are not one among them. Like any
other secured creditors, debenture holders are entitled to lay their hands on the assets secured in their favour for recovery
of their dues. They are placed on the same footing as other secured creditors. The sub-classes of creditors may be relevant
only if different treatment is given/ offered in the scheme. If the same treatment is given to all secured creditors including
debenture holders in the scheme, then there is no requirement of classifying the debenture holders as a separate class.
In this behalf I refer to the Division Bench judgement of this Court in the case of Mafatlal Industries reported in (1996) 87
Comp. Cases 705 (Guj) (Coram: C.K. Thakkar (as he was then) & R. Balia, JJ). On page 733 of the said judgement, it has
been observed as under:
“In our opinion, a plain reading of the Section does not leave any doubt where separate terms are offered to separate
classes of shareholders or creditors under the proposed compromise or arrangement, separate meetings are required
to be held in respect of each class of creditors or shareholders for whom separate compromise or arrangement has
been offered Therefore, before adverting to the question whether the appellant-objector constitutes a separate class of
shareholders or not, it has to be seen whether any different terms have been offered to different classes of creditors or
members and whether any classification of members is required to be made in accordance with those distinctions in terms
of the compromise offered to them and whether any such separate meeting was required to be called. The classification of
members or creditors will be founded on the basis of the difference in the terms offered under the scheme. The difference
in terms of the scheme can be the only criterion for identifying the separate class for the purpose of convening a separate
meeting for such class.”
42.4 This Court relies upon the judgement of this Court in the case of Arvind Mills Ltd., reported in (2002) 111 Comp. Cases 118
(Guj). In the said judgement, in para 12 on page 31, it has been observed as under:
“The classification of members or creditors can be founded on the basis of difference in the terms offered under the
scheme. The difference in terms of the scheme can be the only criterion for identifying separate class for the purpose of
convening a separate meeting for such class.”
42.5 The objectors’ contention that the classification should be based on ‘different rights’ besides ‘differential treatment’ is
both legally untenable as also without any substance. It has been consistently held by this Court that the classification
of creditors should be based on the treatment which is being offered to them under the scheme of arrangement. Merely
because debenture-holders have first charge does not make them a separate class distinct from other secured creditors.
42.6 This Court also relies on the decision in the case of SIEL LIMITED, In re reported in 122 Company Cases 536 where the
Delhi High Court has observed on page 553 as under:
“ The scheme proposed may be regarded as a single arrangement with those creditors whom it is intended to bind, if only
if the rights of those creditors are not so dissimilar as to make it impossible for them to consult together with a view to their
common interest. If the rights of those creditors whom the scheme is intended to bind are such as to make it impossible for
them to consult together with a view to their common interest, then the scheme must be regarded as a number of linked
arrangement. In the latter case it will be necessary to have a separate meeting of each class of creditors; a class being
identified by the test that the rights of those creditors within it are not so dissimilar as to make it impossible for them to
consult together with a view to their common interest.”
42.7 On page 555 of the above judgement, the Court has further observed as under:
“ Consequently, there was no necessity of having a separate meeting so far the UTI is concerned as the UTI was also a
secured lender like all other secured creditors and it did not constitute a separate class. In Arvind Mills Limited (supra) the
Gujarat High Court has held that there cannot be a class within the class and the class has to be one type of creditors,
namely, secured creditors, unsecured creditors and working capital lenders as all the secured creditors have similar rights
in the company.”
42.8 Reliance is placed on the decision of this Court in the case of KRIL STANDARD PRODUCTS PRIVATE LTD., In re reported
in 46 Company Cases 203, the judgement delivered by D.A. Desai, J.
42.9 It is no doubt true that in balance sheet, the secured creditors and debenture holders are separately shown. But it is
clear that disclosures in balance sheet are as per the statutory requirements of Schedule VI to the Companies Act and
the applicable accounting standards. But mere separate disclosures cannot make debenture holders a separate class of
creditors. On the contrary, in a balance sheet of a company drawn up in the form given in Schedule VI, debenture holders
are classified under “Secured Creditors”, which shows debenture holders are one part of the “Secured Creditors.”
42.10 This Court relies upon the judgement of the Hon’ble Supreme Court in the case of National Rayon Corporation Ltd. vs.
Commissioner of Income Tax reported in AIR 1997 SC 3487 page 3490 and the relevant portion is para 12 page on 3490.
172
42.11 As regards Articles of Association of the Transferor Company, they contain the standard provisions based on the provisions
of the Companies Act read with relevant rules. There is no specific provision treating debenture holders as a class separate
from the other secured creditors.
DEBENTURE HOLDERS: SEC.117A, 117B & 117C ARE CONSIDERED:
43.1. Sec.117A provides for Debenture trust deed; Sec.117B provides for appointment of debenture trustees and duties of
debenture trustees, and Sec.117C provides for liability of company to create security and debenture redemption reserve.
The issue of debentures is commonly secured by a trust deed by which the property forming the security is charged by
way of mortgage to the trustees. The trust deed provides, the terms and conditions on which the charge is held and may
be enforced. Sub- section (1) provides for time limit for execution of trust deed; sub-section (2) provides for inspection of
copies; and sub-section (3) provides for penalty for default.
43.2. Sec.117B relates to appointment of debenture trustees and their duties. Before issue of prospectus or a letter of offer for
subscription of debentures, the Company has not only to appoint trustees but has also to state on the face of the said
documents that the trustees have given their consent to act as such. The trustees are statutorily required to protect the
interests of the debenture-holders and redress their grievances, in case the company defaults in the payment of interest
or repayment of the principal amount on redemption, as per terms and conditions of issue of debentures. Sub-section (1)
relates to appointment of debenture trustee and proviso to sub-section (1) relates to disqualification for appointment as
debenture trustees. Sub- section (2) to (4) provides for functions of debenture trustees.
43.3. Duties of debenture trustees under SEBI (Debenture Trustees) Regulations, 1993. Duty of debenture trustee to furnish
information to SEBI. Duties and powers of debenture trustees under SEBI Guidelines, 2000. Power of Company Law Board
to restrict creation of further liabilities [sub-section (4)].
43.4. Sec.117C provides for liability of company to create security and debenture redemption reserve. This section makes it
obligatory for every company to issue only secured debentures. In other words, debentures which are not backed by
security cannot be issued. The security is required to be created for issue of debentures, whether through prospectus or by
rights issue or by way of private placement. A charge is required to be created on the properties of the Company particulars
of which have to be filed with the Registrar within 30 days of the creation of the charge vide provisions of Section 125 of the
Act. It also provides for creation of Debenture Redemption Reserves (DBR) under SEBI Guidelines, 2000. It also provides
for filing of particulars of charge with the Registrar, redemption of debentures [Sub-section (3)], default in redemption -
petition before Company Law Board {Sub-section (4)]. If there is a violation in redeeming the debentures on the date of
maturity, the Directors can be disqualified on failure to redeem debentures on maturity as per provisions of Section 274(g)
of the Companies Act. All these show that the debenture holders are one kind of secured creditors with different protection
but nonetheless they are also one of the class of secured creditors and their right and interest are the same. The Company
gives similar treatment to the debenture holders and secured creditors.
SECTION 391 - 394 - RE: AMALGAMATION: (SEPARATE MEETING OF DEBENTURE HOLDERS & SECURED CREDITORS)
43.5. Section 391 of the Act, particularly deals with the power to compromise or make arrangements with creditors and members
where a compromise or arrangement is proposed - (a) between a company and its creditors or any class of them; or (b)
between itself and its members or any class of them. It covers restructuring, merger, demerger and hiving off of a unit by a
company. The consent of the company in general meeting under section 293(1) of the Act is also required for hiving off an
undertaking of the company.
43.6. The creditors can be divided into three categories of preferential creditors, secured creditors and unsecured creditors. In
the case of Miheer H.Mafatlal v. Mafatlal Industries Ltd. (1996) 87 Com. Cases 792 at 833 (SC), the Hon’ble Apex Court
considered Sec. 391 and observed that this clearly pre-supposes that if the scheme of arrangement or compromise is
offered to the members as a class and no separate scheme is offered to any sub-class of members which has a separate
interest and a separate scheme to consider, no question of holding a separate meeting of such a sub- class would at
all survive. Consequently when one and the same scheme is offered to the entire class of equity shareholders for their
consideration and when commercial interest of the appellant so far as the scheme is concerned is in common with other
equity shareholders, he would have a common cause with them either to accept or to reject the scheme from commercial
point of view.
43.7 The Supreme Court in Mafatlal’s case (supra) has referred to PALMER’S COMPANY LAW, 24th Edition; and also some
English cases, and ultimately on page 34, the Hon’ble Apex Court observed that, it is therefore, obvious that unless a separate
and different type of scheme of compromise is offered to a sub-class of a class of creditors or shareholders otherwise equally
circumscribed by the class, no separate meeting of such sub-class of the main class of members or creditors is required to be
convened.
43.8 As the company has offered similar compromise to both secured creditors and debenture holders and the secured creditors
have similar interest with that of debenture holders, both of them have common interest and thus the debenture holders and
secured creditors can be treated as single. This is a question of fact and the Chairman of the Company has considered this
aspect in this behalf.
43.9 As regards different treatment given to debenture holders from the secured creditors on the basis of the balance sheet of
the IPCL, the Company submitted that under the Scheme, the treatment given to the secured creditors including debenture
holders is identical. There is no change in the rights and interest of the secured creditors (including debenture holders), post
amalgamation. The securities which are in favour of the secured creditors (including debenture holders) or the reserves for
debenture holders is not going to be affected any change post amalgamation. Thus, as per the well settled principle of law
that a common meeting can be convened, for the class of creditors who are given same/similar treatment in the scheme
of amalgamation; a common meeting was convened in the instant case, for the class comprising secured creditors and
debenture holders. The said action is, therefore, neither irregular nor illegal.
43.10 ‘Classes of creditors’: The Court has to classify creditors or members if there are such classes and before sanctioning the
scheme, to see that their respective interests are taken care of. (Maneckchowk & Ahmedabad Mfg. Co. Ltd. Re: (1970) 40
Com. Cases 819 (Guj.). Re: BUCKLEY ON THE COMPANIES ACT, 13th Edition, page 406 (para 525.24)
173
OBSERVATION REGARDING DEBENTURE HOLDERS AND SECURED CREDITORS:
44. The learned counsel has relied on several contentions and the Company has also tried to reply to the same. This Court has
considered all the aspects. There are certain factors which this Court has set out. As regards meeting of Secured Creditors,
initial aspects this Court has recorded. As regards Secured Creditors including debenture holders there were 51 persons
present and all have voted in favour of the scheme. No debenture holder or secured creditor has voted against the scheme.
Only three votes were declared invalid, value of which is 0.25 crores. In view of the fact that there were 51 secured creditors
including debenture holders present, all of whom have voted in favour, this Court is of the view that the contention of the
learned counsel for the applicants will not survive. Even if one takes into consideration the different value attached to the
debenture holders or the secured creditors, that will have no effect as far as approval of the scheme is concerned.
44.1 In view of the same, reliance placed by the learned counsel for the applicant- objector on the judgement of the National
Rayon Corporation Ltd. as well as the judgement of the Madras High Court will have no relevance in this behalf.
PROXY:
45.1 Objection of objector regarding blank proxies is that they are signed by some of the employees-shareholders under
pressure. This Court considered the contention of the applicant as well as the Company’s reply. The aforesaid objections
raised by the applicant/ objector is not well founded and is clearly an afterthought because earlier no single person has
addressed any letter to the Chairman of the Court convening meeting or before the Company for withdrawal of the proxies.
45.2 In view of the averments made by the learned counsel for the Company, at the time of the meetings, the Chairman had
assured that even if the employee-shares have given proxies earlier, but if they are personally present in the meeting,
then they will be entitled to vote and the proxy would be held invalid while their votes would be considered. The Chairman
had also instructed scrutineers accordingly. The Chairman’s report also states in this behalf. In view of this report of the
Chairman, in my view, the contention of the objector regarding blank proxy forms is not well founded and is liable to be
rejected.
SCHEME OF SECTIONS 391 TO 394:
45.3 After considering all the objections, now this Court considers Sections 391 to 394A of the Companies Act which read as
under:
45.4 (1) “Section 391 of the Companies Act - Power to compromise or make arrangements with creditors and members -
“(1) Where a compromise or arrangement is proposed - (a) between a company and its creditors or any class of
them; or (b) between a company and its members or any class of them; the Court may, on the application of the
company or of any creditor or member of the company, or, in the case of a company which is being wound up, of
the liquidator, order a meeting of the creditors or class of creditors, or of the members or class of members, as the
case may be, to be called, held and conducted in such manner as the Court directs.
(2) If a majority in number representing three-fourths in value of the creditors, or class of creditors, or members, or class
of members, as the case may be, present and voting either in person or, where proxies are allowed (under the rules
made under Section 643), by proxy, at the meeting, agree to any compromise or arrangement, the compromise or
arrangement shall, if sanctioned by the Court be binding on all the creditors, all the creditors of the class, all the members,
or all the members of the class, as the case may be, and also on the company, or in the case of a company which is being
wound up, on the liquidator and contributories of the company: (provided that no order sanctioning any compromise
or arrangement shall be made by the Court unless the Court is satisfied that the company or any other person by
whom an application has been made under sub-section (1) has disclosed to the Court, by affidavit or otherwise, all
material facts relating to the company, such as the latest financial position of the company, the latest auditor’s report
on the accounts of the company, the pendency of any investigation proceedings in relation to the company under
Sections 235 to 251 and the like).
45.4(2) Power of Court to enforce compromise and arrangement:
“Section 392(1) Where the Court makes an order under section 391 sanctioning compromise or an arrangement in respect
of a company, if -
(a) shall have a power to supervise the carrying out of the compromise or an arrangement; and
(b) may, at the time of making such order or at any time thereafter, give such directions in regard to any matter or make
such modifications in the compromise or arrangement as it may consider necessary for the proper working of the
compromise or arrangement.
(2) If the Court aforesaid is satisfied that a compromise or arrangement sanctioned under Section 391 cannot be
worked satisfactorily with or without modifications, it may, either on its own motion or on the application of any
person interested in the affairs of the company, make an order winding up the company, and such an order shall
be deemed to be an order made under Section 433 of this Act.”
45.4 (3) Notice to be given to Central Government for application under Sections 391 and 394
 “Sec. 394A - The Court shall give notice of every application made to it under Section 391 or 394 to the Central
Government, and shall take into consideration the representations, if any, made to it by that Government before
passing any order under any of these Sections.”
45.4 (4) Section 392 - Power of Court to enforce compromise and arrangement: This section provides for enforcement of
the scheme of arrangement etc. sanctioned under Sec.391.
45.4 (5) Section 393: Information as to compromises or arrangements with creditors and members.
45.4 (6) Section 394: This section provides provisions for facilitating reconstruction and amalgamation of companies.
174
IMPORTANCE OF SECTIONS:
45.5 The word ‘arrangement’ means something analogous in some sense to a compromise. Sec.391 applies to ‘compromise’ or
‘arrangements’.
45.6 The word ‘arrangement’ in this section is liable to be interpreted widely. When a proposed scheme affected the contractual
relationship subsisting between the company and its members by requiring the company to register a third party applicant
in place of existing members as the holder of the company's shares, the scheme was an arrangement within the meaning
of this section.
45.7 “Arrangement”, the word is of wide import and includes reorganisation of share capital by the consolidation of different
classes of shares or division of shares into shares of different classes or by both the methods.
MERGER / AMALGAMATION:
45.8 What is meant by “Merger” - Meaning of “merger” -
“Merger means the fusion or absorption of one company by another, the latter retaining its own name and identity and
acquiring assets, liabilities, franchises and powers of former, and the absorbed company ceasing to exist as a separate
entity. It differs from a consolidation wherein all the corporations terminate their existence and become parties to a new
one. (Halsbury’s Laws of India Vol. 27, para 40.634 page No. 415)
45.8A What is meant by amalgamation -
“Amalgamation or reconstruction has no precise legal meaning. In amalgamation, two or more companies are fused into
one by merger or by taking over by another. When two companies are merged and are so joined as to form a third company
or one is absorbed into the other or blended with another, the amalgamating company loses its identity. Amalgamation is a
blending of two or more existing undertakings into one undertaking, the shareholders of each blending company becoming
substantially the shareholders in the company which is to carry on the blended undertakings. There may be amalgamation
either by the transfer of two or more undertakings to a new company, or by the transfer of one or more undertakings to an
existing company. Strictly, amalgamation does not, it seems, cover the mere acquisition by a company of the share capital
of the other company which remains in existence and continues its undertakings, but the context in which the term is used
may show that it is intended to include such an acquisition.” (Re: Halsbury’s Laws of India, Vol.27, para 40.636 page No.
415)
45.9 The duties of the Court under these Sections are onerous and have to be carefully performed. Consideration of public
interest has to be considered while exercising power under Sec.394 of the Act.
Hindustan Lever Employees Union v. Hindustan Lever Ltd. s(1995) 83 Com. Cases 30 [at pp.39, 40, 63, 64].
GENERAL OBSERVATIONS REGARDING THE SCHEME:
45.10 When considering sanction of a scheme, the Court has to consider the following aspects:
(1) The meeting was duly held and conducted;
(2) The compromise was a real compromise;
(3) It was accepted by a competent majority;
(4) That the majority was acting in good faith and for common advantage of the whole class; and
(5) that what they did was reasonable, prudent and proper.
45.11 The Court has also to satisfy itself that:
45.11 (1) Whether the provisions of the statute have been complied with;
45.11 (2) Whether the scheme is reasonable and practical or whether there is any reasonable objection to it;
45.11 (3) Whether the creditors acted honestly and in good faith and had sufficient information;
45.11 (4) Whether the Court ought in the public interest to override the decision of the creditors and shareholders.
[Re: CHPL Enterprises P.Ltd. Re. (2000) 2 Comp. L.J. 218 (AP)].
45.12 In a scheme, which is fair and reasonable and made in good faith, may be sanctioned if it could reasonably be supported
by sensible people to be for the benefit to each class of the members or creditors concerned. If the Court is satisfied that
the scheme is fair and reasonable and in the interests of the general body of shareholders, the Court will not make any
provision in favour of the dissentients.
45.13 Where a scheme is found to be reasonable and fair, it is not a function of the Court to substitute its judgment for the
collective wisdom of the shareholders of the companies involved.
45.14 Where the scheme of amalgamation which enjoyed an all-round approval including that of the official liquidator, creditors
and employees, it was confirmed by the Court with effect that it became binding on all the shareholders, creditors, secured
and unsecured of both the Companies.
45.15 Where there is no allegation of mala fides or fraud against the valuation done for the share exchange ratio. The Company
Court would not go into the controversy of the valuation as the shareholders of the transferee company had accepted the
ratio arrived at by the auditors. The scheme had to to be presumed to be fair and just, as, except a fraction of the concerned
shareholders, all had consciously voted for the scheme and had accepted it to be in their larger interests, it had to be
sanctioned.
175
45.16 The effective date of scheme : A compromise or arrangement takes effect from the date when it is arrived at subject to the
sanction of the court. If the court refuses sanction, it becomes without effect. If the court grants sanction, it takes effect,
not from the date of the sanction, but from the date when it was arrived at. Sanction of the Court to a compromise has
relation back and a scheme or arrangement agreed to by the creditors of a company becomes operative from the date of
the meeting in which it is agreed to and not from the date on which the Court’s sanction is given.
45.17 This Court relies upon the decision of the Hon’ble Supreme Court in Hindustan Lever and another v. State of Maharashtra
and another (2004) 9 SCC 438, para 11, “While exercising its power in sanctioning a scheme of agreement, the Court has
to examine as to whether the provisions of the statute have been complied with. Once the Court finds that the parameters
set out in Section 394 of the Companies Act have been met then the Court would have no further jurisdiction to sit in appeal
over the commercial wisdom of the class of persons who with their eyes open give their approval, even if, in the view of the
Court a better scheme could have been framed”.
45.18 This Court further relies on para 9 to 13 and 18 of the judgment reported in Hindustan Lever and Another Vs. State of
Maharashtra and another (2004) 9 SCC 438. This Court also relies upon Miheer Mafatlal vs. Mafatlal Industries Ltd., (1997)
1 SCC 579 and also on the Torrent Powers - AEC Ltd., (2007) 138 Comp. Cases 139 (Guj).
GENERAL OBSERVATIONS:
46.1 On behalf of some of the employees shareholders it was contended that IPCL was originally Government of India
undertaking. In 2002 in part disinvestment, the Reliance Petroleum took 26% shares of the Company and took control over
the IPCL. It was further submitted that now the IPCL as well as Reliance desires to amalgamate. The idea of Reliance is
to take advantage of the assets of IPCL so that they may use its reserves and some of the assets of IPCL. The aforesaid
contention is wholly erroneous in this context. Along with Company Petition No.93/07, they have annexed the Balance
Sheet for the year 2005-2006 i.e. Year ended 31.3.2006. In the said Balance Sheet, on page 29, the financial highlights
of 10 years at a glance have been shown. In that for the year ended 31.3.2002, the turnover was 5527 crores. The total
income was 5691 crores and profit after tax was 107 crores. After Reliance Petroleum took 26% shares and handle the
management for the year 2005-2006, the turn over comes to 12,362 crores, total income comes to Rs.12,629 crores and
profit after tax comes to 1164 crores. This shows that the financial management of IPCL is very well and the turn over
comes almost more than double, but profit is increased 10 times. This shows that the policy has been carried out and put
the IPCL in great profitable things.
46.2 One of the contentions on behalf of some of the employees shareholders stated that recent amalgamation of six sick units,
viz., Apollo Fibers Limited, Central India Polyesters Limited, India Polyfibers Limited, Orissa Polyfibers Limited, Recron
Synthetics Limited and Silvassa Industries Private Limited into IPCL in the year 2006 has resulted in a reduction of IPCL’s
profit at least on paper. This aspect ought to have been factored in by the experts while determining the share exchange
ratio.
46.3 The aforesaid contention is also clearly an afterthoughts as this amalgamation was in 2006 and the said order of
amalgamation has not been challenged and therefore the shareholders of IPCL was already acquiesced in this behalf.
There is great delay in challenging the said acquisition in the present proceedings. In fact, the present proceedings is not
proper proceedings to challenge the said amalgamation in this behalf.
46.4 As indicated above, even the turn over, the total income and profit after tax has substantially increased from time to time.
The turn over for the year 3.3.2005, it was 9386 crores rose to 12,362 crores. The turn over in 2005 was 9518 crores rose
to 12,620 crores in 31.3.2006 and the profit it was 786 crores for the year 2005 rose to 1164 crores. So the aforesaid fact
clearly shows that the aforesaid contention is not borne out from the record of the case.
46.5 The Transferor Company has annexed the balance-sheet of IPCL for the year ended on 31.3.2006. In one page Financial
Highlight for 10 years at a glance have been shown. The said page is annexed to this judgement at Annexure- A which
shows that since 10 years IPCL has made immense growth particularly after 2002 when disinvestment of the IPCL took
place. The turnover has increased almost more than two and half times. Income is also increased almost two and half
times. Earning before depreciation, interest and tax is also increased. Profit after tax is increased almost ten times. Equity
dividend percentage is almost doubled. Dividend payout is also increased. Equity share capital reserves and surplus have
also been increased. As regards key indicators, earning per share is also increased. Turnover per share, book value per
share, net profit margin have also been increased. This shows that the Company has worked very well. Therefore, the
allegation of the objectors that RIL who has taken over after 2002 wants to take advantage of the assets of IPCL as well as
its reserves is misplaced and baseless.
FINAL DIRECTION:
47.1 That the arrangement embodied in the Scheme of Amalgamation being Exhibit “G” to the petition is sanctioned by this
Court as to be binding with effect from 1st April, 2006, the Appointed Date, on the Company and the Transferee Company
and all their respective shareholders and creditors and all concerned persons;
47.2 That with effect from the Appointed Date and subject to Part III of the Scheme of Amalgamation, the whole of the undertaking
of the Transferor Company including all the properties, rights and powers of the Transferor Company as specified in
Schedule I hereto and all other properties, rights and powers of the Transferor Company shall, pursuant to the provisions
of Sections 391 to 394 and other applicable provisions, if any, of the Companies Act stand transferred to and vested in or
be deemed to have been transferred to and vested in the Transferee Company, as a going concern without any further
act, instrument, deed, matter or thing so as to become the undertaking of the Transferee Company by virtue of and in the
manner provided in the Scheme of Amalgamation.
47.3 That with effect from the Appointed Date, all liabilities of every kind, nature and description of the Transferor Company
shall, pursuant to the provisions of Sections 391 to 394 of the Companies Act and other applicable provisions, if any, of the
Companies Act, be restructured in the manner set out in Part III of the Scheme of Amalgamation.
47.4 That with effect from the Appointed Date, all liabilities of every kind, nature and description of the Transferor Company
shall, pursuant to the provisions of Sections 391 to 394 of the Companies Act and other applicable provisions, if any, of
the Companies Act, stand transferred or be deemed to be transferred to the Transferee Company, without any further
176
act, instrument, deed, matter or thing and the same shall be assumed by the Transferee Company to the extent they
are outstanding on the Effective Date so as to become as and from the Appointed Date the liabilities of the Transferee
Company on the same terms and conditions as were applicable to the Transferor Company and the Transferee Company
shall meet, discharge and satisfy the same and it shall not be necessary to obtain the consent of any third party or other
person who is a party to any contract or arrangement by virtue of which such liabilities have arisen in order to give effect to
such transfer.
47.5 That the Transferee Company shall, without any further application, act, instrument or deed, issue and allot to
the equity shareholders of the Transferor company, whose names are registered in the Register of Members of
the Transferor Company on the Record Date (to be fixed by the Board of Directors of the Transferee Company or
a Committee of such Board of Directors) or his/ her/ its heirs, executors or, as the case may be, successors, equity
shares of Rs.10/- (Rupees Ten only) each, credited as fully paid up of the Transferee Company, in the ratio of
1 equity share of the face value of Rs.10/- (Rupees Ten only) of the Transferee Company with rights attached
hereto as mentioned in this Scheme for every 5 equity shares of the face value of Rs.10/- (Rupees Ten only) each credited
as fully paid-up held by such equity shareholders or their respective heirs, executors or, as the case may be, successors
in the Transferor Company.
47.6 That in consideration of the transfer and vesting of the undertaking of the Petitioner Company in the Transferee Company,
pursuant to the provisions of this Scheme, the Transferee Company shall instruct its depository (the “Transferee Depository”)
to issue GDRs of the Transferee Company to the existing eligible holders of GDRs of the Transferor Company in an
appropriate manner in respect of the existing GDRs of the Transferor Company, in accordance with applicable law and the
terms of the deposit agreement entered into amongst the Transferee Company, the Bank of New York and all registered
holders of and beneficial owners from time to time of the GDRs of the Transferee Company (the “Deposit Agreement”). The
Transferor Company shall issue necessary instructions to its depository (the “Transferee Depository”) and the Transferee
Company, the Transferee Depository, the Transferor Company and the Transferor Depository shall enter into such further
documents as may be necessary and appropriate in this behalf, which shall contain all detailed terms and conditions of
such issue.
47.7 That all the employees of the Petitioner Company who are in employment as on the Effective Date shall become the
employees of the Transferee Company with effect from the Effective Date without any break or interruption in service and
on the same terms and conditions as to employment and remuneration on which they are engaged or employed by the
Petitioner Company (subject to option which is provided in operative order).
47.8 That on and from the Effective Date, all suits, actions and legal proceedings by or against the Petitioner Company shall be
continued and/ or enforced by or against the Transferee Company as effectually and in the same manner and to the same
extent as if the same and been instituted and/ or pending and/or arising by or against the name of the Transferee Company
(it also includes operative direction given regarding ancillary industries also).
47.9 That the Petitioner Company shall stand dissolved without winding-up as provided for in the Scheme of Amalgamation.
48. Here in this case IPCL has merged with Reliance Industries Limited. It is no doubt true that both the Companies are big and once
these two companies are merged, the amalgamated Company will be bigger and global Company. However, this Court is of the
view that even if the Company becomes big in size but this has no relevance unless the Company improves its quality of service to
its customers, workers, shareholders and ultimately for itself then the Company will become globally competitive. The Company is
not known for its size but the quality of service. For that purpose this Court relies on the fundamental Code of Conduct which may
apply to the new company.
FUNDAMENTAL CODE OF CONDUCT
48.1 CONDUCT which is of the highest ethical standards- intellectual, financial and moral and reflects the highest levels of
courtesy and consideration to others.
48.2 CONDUCT which builds and maintains Team work, with mutual trust as the basis of all working relationship.
48.3 CONDUCT which puts the customer first, the Company second and the self last.
48.4 CONDUCT which exemplifies care for the customer through anticipation of need, attention to detail, excellence, aesthetics
and style and respect for privacy along with warmth and concern.
48.5 CONDUCT which demonstrates two-way communication accepting constructive debate and dissent whilst acting fearlessly
with conviction.
48.6 CONDUCT which demonstrates that people are our key asset, through respect for every employee, and leading from the
front regarding performance achievements as well as individual development.
48.7 CONDUCT which at all times safeguards the safety, security, health and environment of customers, employees and the
assets of the Company.
48.8 CONDUCT which eschews the short-term quick-fix for the long-term establishment of healthy precedent.
48.9 Once the transferee company tries to follow the said conduct, this Court hopes and trusts that the new company will consider
that they are committed to meeting and exceedings the expectations of their customers through their unremitting dedication
to perfection, in every aspect of service to their general public; the company will commit to the growth, development and
welfare of their people including the employees upon whom they rely to make this happen; and the company will have
their distinctiveness together the company shall continue to have their tradition of pioneering in the manufacturing industry,
striving for unsurpassed excellence in high potential areas all throughout India and the world and as a result of that they will
create extraordinary value for their stakeholders.

independent Chartered Accountants, this Court will not interfere with the exchange ratio approved by them. All these
contentions are therefore rejected.
8. As far as debenture holders and Secured Creditors are concerned, in view of this Court’s discussion, there is no
substance in this objection. Hence the same is rejected.

provides orders to be drawn up. He has further invited my attention to Form No. 41 under Rule 81 and Form No. 42 under
Rule 84. In view of Rule 37 of The Companies (Court) Rules, 1959 this Court directs that no order need be drawn up by the
Registrar and this order will be a final order and once the Transferor Company files final judgement of this Court along with
operative order, the same will be in compliance with Section 394 read with Form 42 under Rule 84 there will be sufficient
compliance and the Transferor Company need not file Schedule particularly Part-I, II and III of the said Form No. 42. The
same will be sufficient compliance of Sections 391(3) & 394(3) of the Companies Act.

11. After pronouncement of the judgment, Shri Girish Patel, learned Senior Counsel with Mr. Shalin Mehta, learned advocate
appeared for some of the objectors submitted that the effect and operation of implementation of the judgment be stayed for
some time enabling the objectors to approach the appellate forum.
12. Mr. K.S. Nanavati, learned Senior Counsel states that in amalgamation matter normally when the Court sanctioned the
scheme, there is no question of granting any stay. He has relied upon the judgment of this Court in [2007] 138 Company
Cases 204 in the matter of Core Health Care Limited where also in similar circumstances when the objectors asked for stay,
this Court rejected the said prayer of stay. He has further stated that in that very matter, O.J. Appeal was filed being O.J.
Appeal No. 36 of 2007 by HDFC Bank Limited and in that Civil Application No.99 of 2007 was filed. The Division Bench of
this Court (Coram: M.S. Shah and H.B. Antani, JJ.) by order dated 4.4.2007 pleased to pass the following order:
178
“Rule returnable on 18.4.2007. Mrs. Swati Soparkar waives service of rule on behalf of Core Health Care Ltd. and Nirma
Ltd. Any action which the respondents take shall be subject to the result of the appeal and the beneficiary shall also be
informed accordingly.
Notice shall also be issued to the learned Standing Central Government Counsel.”
13. In view of this, Mr. Nanavati stated that even the Appellate Court also does not grant stay, there is no question of granting
stay by this Court.
14. In view of the order passed by this Court, one by learned Single Judge and also Division Bench, this Court therefore reject
the prayer of stay made by learned Senior Counsel Shri Girish Patel with Mr.Shalin Mehta. In view of the same, the said
prayer is rejected.

JUDGMENT :
1. This Petition is moved by Reliance Industries Ltd. to obtain sanction to the scheme of Amalgamation of Reliance Petroleum Ltd.
(Transferor company) with Reliance Industries Limited (Transferee Company). The Transferor Company is 75% subsidiary of the
Transferee Company.
2. The Petitioner Company was incorporated as Mynylon Limited sometime on 8th May, 1973 in the State of Karnataka under
the provisions of Companies Act, 1956. That name was subsequently changed to Reliance Textile Industries Limited on 11th
March, 1977. Later on, the place of registered office of the Petitioner company was changed from State of Karnataka to State of
Maharashtra, on the 2nd day of July, 1977. Thereafter, the name of the Petitioner Company was changed to Reliance Industries
Limited on 27th June, 1985. The shares of the Petitioner Company are listed on the Bombay Stock Exchange and the National
Stock Exchange of India.
3. The Petitioner Company has been established to carry on business set out in the Memorandum of Association, which is appended
to the Petition. The Board of Directors of both the Transferor as well as Transferee Company in their respective Board Meetings
approved the proposed scheme, keeping in mind the exchange ratio suggested by M/s. Ernst & Young Private Limited and M/s.
Morgan Stanley India Company Private Limited. The said swap ratio was approved by other two consultants appointed to give their
fairness report namely Merrill Lynch and City Group Global Market India Ltd.
4. The Board of Directors of the Petitioner Company in its meeting on 2nd March, 2009 approved the scheme. The Scheme also
received approval from the Bombay Stock Exchange and National Stock Exchange on 2nd March, 2009. On the basis of the said
approval, the Petitioner Company filed Company Application No.288 of 2009 in this Court seeking direction to convene meetings
of its Equity Shareholders, Secured Creditors(including Debenture holders) and unsecured Creditors to seek their approval to
the Scheme. That application was filed on 3rd March, 2009. This Court, by Order dated 6th March, 2009, directed the Petitioner
Company to convene requisite meetings on 4th April, 2009. Accordingly, separate meetings of the Equity Shareholders, Secured
Creditors(including Debenture Holders) and unsecured Creditors of the Petitioner Company were convened and held on 4th April,
2009. In the meeting of the Equity Shareholders, 5813 Equity Shareholders holding 106,76,27,438 Equity Shares attended either
personally or by proxy or by authorized representatives. Out of these 5642 Equity Shareholders holding in aggregate 106,75,59,806
equity shares constituting 98.861% in number and representing 99.9998% in holding Equity Shares were present in person or by
proxy and voting at the meeting, voted in favour of the Scheme. On the other hand, 65 equity shareholders holding in aggregate
2143 equity shares constituting 1.139% in number and representing 0.0002% in holding of the equity shares, present in person
or by proxy and voting at the meeting, voted against the Scheme. Besides, 106 Equity shareholders holding 65,489 votes were
declared invalid. As a result, the Scheme was approved by overwhelming majority of the Equity Shareholders, present and voting
either in person or by proxy at the said meeting. In the meeting of Secured Creditors held on the same day on 4th April, 2009, it was
attended by 39 Secured Creditors (including debenture holders) either personally or by proxy or by authorized representative. Out
of them 38 Secured Creditors(including debenture holders) having aggregate outstanding value of Rs.5878 Crore and constituting
100% in number representing 100% in value, present in person or by proxy and voting at the meeting, voted in favour of the
Scheme. No Secured Creditors(including debenture holders) present in person or by proxy and voting at the meeting, voted against
the Scheme. The vote of one secured creditor (including debenture holders) having aggregate outstanding value of Rs.12 Crore
was declared invalid. Accordingly, the scheme was approved unanimously by the Secured creditors(including debenture holders)
present and voting, either in person or by proxy at the said meeting. In the meeting of unsecured Creditors, 994 unsecured creditors
either personally or by proxy or authorized representative attended the said meeting. Out of them 801 unsecured creditors having
aggregate outstanding value of Rs.566.76 Crore and constituting 100% in number representing 100% in value, present in person or
by proxy and voting at the meeting, voted in favour of the Scheme. No unsecured creditors present in person or by proxy and voting
at the meeting, voted against the Scheme. Whereas, votes of 193 unsecured creditors having outstanding value of Rs.13.37 crores
were declared invalid. Accordingly, the scheme was approved unanimously by the unsecured creditors present either in person or
by proxy and voting at the said meetings.
5. After the Scheme was duly approved by overwhelming majority of the Equity shareholders and unanimously by the Secured and
unsecured Creditors, present Petition has been moved by the Transferee Company for sanction of the scheme of amalgamation
under section 391/394 of the Companies Act, on 6th April, 2009. The Petition was admitted on 9th April, 2009 and fixed for final
hearing on 8th May, 2009. The record indicates that Notice of hearing of the Petition was duly served on the Regional Director,
Registrar of Company and Central Government Advocate, as can be discerned from the affidavit of service filed in this Court.
Besides, notice of hearing was published in specified newspapers as is stated in the affidavit of service. After publication of notice,
three objectors have come forward to oppose the scheme. One Mr.Anup Kumar Seth filed his affidavit to oppose the scheme, on
6th May, 2009. Similarly, one Mr.Jayendra M. Shah filed his affidavit to oppose the scheme, on 6th May, 2009. The third objector
Mr.Shailesh Mehta filed his affidavit on 7th May, 2009. When the Petition came up for hearing on 8th May, 2009, it was adjourned
as the Regional Director did not file his report. Later on, the matter was directed to be listed on 19th June, 2009 when the objector
Mr.Shailesh P. Mehta submitted his affidavit titled as Revised limited Affidavit of objection, which he wanted to be taken on record
and to ignore his previous affidavit already filed on record . That request was accepted. Matter was then taken up for hearing on
25th June, 2009. On that date, the above said objectors were represented by Counsel. After the Counsel for the said Objectors
were fully heard, one Mr.Vishvesh M. Raste appeared in person and wanted to hand over his affidavit to oppose the present
scheme. That request was rejected keeping in mind that his objection was not filed within the time prescribed by Rule 34 of the
Company Court Rules. The arguments were then concluded and the Petition deferred for pronouncement of order. However, on
26th June, 2009, the Company Registrar drew my attention to the fact that one more objection has been received in the Registry by
post from one Mr. Rasiklal S. Mardia. For the same reason noted in my order dated June 25, 2009, I would not take cognizance of
this objection received by post; and especially because it has been brought to my notice(in chamber)after conclusion of the hearing
of the Petition.
6. Be that as it may, it is noticed from the record that the Petitioner company has complied with all the statutory formalities. In that, the
Board of Directors of the Petitioner Company as well as the Transferor Company in their respective Board meetings held on 2nd
March, 2009, have approved the proposed scheme. Both the Transferor and Transferee companies being listed Companies, have
obtained approval from the concerned Stock Exchanges. The Petitioner thereafter filed application seeking direction from this Court
to hold meeting of its shareholders and creditors to seek their approval to the scheme. This Court issued certain directions on 6th
March, 2009, including to hold meetings on 4th April, 2009. The Petitioner Company has complied with the directions given by this
Court. It is noticed that all the relevant documents including valuation report and fairness opinion issued in relation to the scheme
were kept for inspection of the shareholders and creditors of the Petitioner Company upto the date of meetings. In the meeting
181
of the Equity Shareholders, Secured Creditors(including debenture holders) and Unsecured Creditors of the Petitioner company
convened on 4th April, 2009, the Scheme was approved with overwhelming majority of the Equity Shareholders and unanimously
by the Secured Creditors(including debenture holders) and Unsecured Creditors of the Petitioner Company, present and voting at
the respective meetings. Significantly, the Regional Director and the Registrar of Companies have also consented for approving
the proposed scheme. Ordinarily, in this backdrop, the Court would readily accord approval to the proposed scheme keeping in
mind, the well established position restated in the case of Mafatlal Industries Ltd. reported in (1996)87 Comp. Cases page 792. The
Supreme Court has expounded the broad contours to be borne in mind while considering the request for sanction of the scheme.
It is well established that the Court cannot undertake the exercise of scrutinising the scheme placed for its sanction with a view to
find out whether a better scheme could have been adopted by the parties. In the same decision, the Apex Court has observed that
such exercise remains only for the parties and is in the realm of commercial democracy permeating the activities of the concerned
creditors and members of the company who in their best commercial and economic interest of majority agree to give green signal
to such a compromise or arrangement.
7. However, the objectors who appeared before this Court through Counsel have vehementally argued that the Court should decline
to exercise its discretion in according approval to the proposed scheme. Although the objectors have filed detailed affidavit in this
Court, however, the points agitated before the Court at the time of argument by the learned Counsel were as follows.
8. Firstly, it was contended that the act of the Petitioner Company smacks of undue haste, as can be seen from the admitted dates.
In that, the Board Meeting of the Transferee Company was held on 27th February, 2009, in which decision to amalgamate two
companies was taken. It was a Friday. It is intriguing that in a short interval of only two days during the weekend, valuation report
was prepared by Morgan Stanley on Monday the 2nd March, 2009. Not only that, the fairness report of other two experts was
obtained on the same day on 2nd March, 2009 and the Board of Directors proceeded to pass resolution at 10.15 a.m. on the same
day on 2nd March, 2009. These circumstances clearly indicate that the matter was hastened by the Petitioner Company for reasons
best known to them. It is also possible to suggest, contends the Learned Counsel that it is a clear case of non- application of mindnot only of the Board of Directors, but also by the valuers appointed by the Petitioner Company. The next criticism by the Counsel
for objector Shailesh Mehta was in relation to the contents of the valuation report. He was at pains to point out that the valuers’
report if read clause by clause or as a whole clearly indicates that no details are forthcoming. Forecast is not given, nor the valuation
of the shares of the Transferee Company and the basis on which the same is done can be discerned. He submits that the Report
clearly admits of the fact that due diligence has not been carried out. In his submission, the report gives conflicting opinion, without
disclosing any logic. Besides, it is only a document stating the conclusion of the valuers. Even with regard to the contents of the
fairness report, similar criticism was made. It was stated that the basis on which the report is founded is not disclosed in any of this
report. Adopting the same argument Counsel for the other objector Mr.Anup Kumar Seth, additionally argued that valuation done
by the third Valuer M/s. City Group has not been produced by the Petitioner Company. The Valuation/Fairness Reports, according
to him, fail to give arithmetical calculation on the basis of which the final conclusion has been reached by the concerned expert. It is
argued that the reports are unintelligible. In that, no relevant and material information is made available to the Court by the experts
regarding the justification of swap ratio. The report is a veiled document so as to deny the relevant information in relation to the
subject matter on hand. That would disable the Court to reach at a correct conclusion. It is further submitted that objectors have
suggested different methods, which would benefit the shareholders. Moreover, it is contended that crucial fact that there are some
proceedings pending regarding Gas Supply Agreement between the Petitioner Company and M/s.Reliance Natural Resources Ltd,
have not been taken into account. For, the impact due to the outcome of the said proceedings qua the Petitioner Company has
not been reckoned at all though relevant. Indeed, the reply filed by the Petitioner company records that the same has been duly
considered, which fact, however, cannot be substantiated from the reports. It was then argued that 41% shares of the Petitioner
Company have been acquired by group companies. It was argued that the swap ratio determined was unfair to the Shareholders
of the Petitioner Company. Counsel for the said objectors in the alternative submitted that the Court may direct revaluation and
invite fresh report from an independent valuer. It was argued that the two companies ought to prepare separate books of accounts
which alone would facilitate the true valuation of the shares of the respective companies. Relying on the averments in the affidavit
filed by the Regional Director that all intercompany transactions between the Transferor Company and Petitioner company will
be eliminated in the Books of Account, it was argued that even Regional Director has taken exception to grant of approval to the
proposed scheme. It was also argued that there are certain proceedings and investigations pending against the Petitioner company
before the Regulatory Authority. The attempt of propounding the present scheme was to frustrate the said pending action. For all
these reasons, it was argued that the Court may reject the present Petition. These are the broad arguments which were canvassed
across the bar and in my Judgment I would deal with the same a little later.
9. As aforesaid, the scope of intervention by the Company Judge while considering the scheme of amalgamation such as the present
one, is no more res integra. The objections which are canvassed before this Court in my opinion, would not militate against the
Petitioner Company. For, it cannot be said that any requisite statutory procedure has not been complied with. Nor it is a case
where the scheme is not supported by requisite majority of votes of class of stakeholders. Significantly, in the present case the
Companies appointed a renowned firm to undertake the determination of swap ratio of the respective shares. No one has doubted
the integrity or honesty of the said expert. Moreover, the Company got checked and approved the opinion of the former by two other
independent firms, who in turn have agreed with the said determination to be fair. It is also not possible to take the view that the
concerned meetings of the Creditors or members or any class of them were not furnished with the relevant material to enable them
to arrive at an informed decision for approving the scheme in question. On the other hand, it is noticed that requisite majority of the
concerned class of voters have found the scheme to be just and fair to the class as a whole. If so, their decision would legitimately
bind even the dissenting members of that class. It is not the case of the objector that necessary material indicated under section
393 was not placed before the voters at the concerned meeting, as was required to be held in terms of Section 391 and directions
given by this Court. Moreover, all the requisite material envisaged under section 391(2) have been placed before the Court by
the Petitioner Company. Going by the said material, it is not possible to take the view that the scheme is prejudicial either to the
shareholders or the public. As a matter of fact, the Registrar of Companies as well as the Regional Director including the concerned
Stock Exchanges have given approval/consent to the proposed scheme. Nothing has been brought to my notice so as to take the
view that the scheme is violative of any provisions of law or against the public policy. The scheme as a whole is found to be just,
fair and reasonable from the point of view of taking commercial decision which is beneficial to class represented by them for whom
the scheme is made.
10. In other words, all parameters to be borne in mind have been fulfilled in the present case. It necessarily follows that the Court
will have no jurisdiction to sit over the commercial wisdom of the majority of the class of persons, who with their open eyes have
given approval to the scheme. The Apex Court in the case of Hindustan Lever Employees’ Union Vs. Hindustan Lever Ltd [AIR
182
1995 SC 470] has rejected similar argument of the Petitioner therein-that if some other method was to be adopted, probably the
determination of valuation could have been bit more in favour of the shareholders. In other words, merely because some other
method of valuation could be resorted to and would be bit favourable to the shareholders, that alone cannot militate against granting
approval to the scheme propounded by the Company. The Court expounded that what is imperative is that the determination should
not contrary to law and/or unfair for the Shareholders of the Company which was being merged. The Court’s obligation is to be
satisfied that valuation was in accordance with law and it was carried out by an independent body.
11. In the case of Re Tata Oil Mills Co. Ltd. in (1994) 81 Comp.Cases 754(Bom)]. This Court while considering objection of the
shareholders that alternative share exchange ratio would have been appropriate and that the exchange ratio arrived at by the
Company was incorrect, observed thus:
“In my opinion, the exchange ratio as arrived at by Mr.Malegam has received
the approval of shareholders holding more than 99 per cert.(in number and
value) shares at the meetings. No one except the shareholders holding minimum
percentage of shares have complained before me. The valuation has been
confirmed to be fair by two eminent firms of auditors. It would be extremely
difficult to hold that the same is unfair. In any case, it has been approved by an
overwhelming majority of persons affected and there is no basis to doubt their
judgment. I, therefore, do not find any substance in this objection.”
This view taken by the High Court has been approved by the Apex Court in the case of Hindustan Lever Employees’ Union (Supra).
As observed earlier, the Apex Court went on to hold that what is imperative is that such determination of valuation or determination
done by the company should not be contrary to the provisions of law or unfair to the class of stakeholder of the Company, which
was being merged. If it was a case covered by such situation, the Court would be within its power to refuse approval to the proposed
scheme. Reliance is rightly placed on the exposition in the decision of our High Court in the case of Re: German Remedies Ltd
reported in (2003) 4 Com.L.J.89(Bom.), which reads thus:
“The valuers had made valuation by considering three methods of valuation
namely the Net Asset value, Profit Earning Value and the Market Value of the
shares of the companies as quoted on the Stock Exchange. The valuers have
arrived at the valuation on the basis of relative valuation of shares of both the
companies based on the aforesaid methodologies and various qualitative factors
relating to each company, business dynamics and growth potential of business.
Valuation is not an exact science. Different methods are applied for valuation.
Valuations made by different methods may widely differ and valuers generally
consider appropriate to adopt weighted average of the valuation determined
by different methodologies to arrive at the fair market value. What weightage
should be given to which factor would depend upon the facts and circumstances
of the case............ As stated earlier, it is again to be kept in mind that the
exchange ratio is in the realm of commercial wisdom of wellinformed equity
share holders. It is not for the court to sit in appeal over th valued judgment of
the equity share holders who are supposed to be commercial men. Commercial
men who know their common benefit and interests underlying the proposed
scheme, with open eyes, have okayed the swap ratio of 7 to 4 as above by an
overwhelming majority of 90 per cent in numbers and 99 per cent in value of the
members present and voting. The limited jurisdiction of the Court is only to see
whether the ratio is so wrong or the error is so gross as would make the scheme
unfair or unjust or oppressive to the majority of the members or any class of them.”
12. That takes me to the grievance of the objectors that the Petitioner Company has introduced the scheme with undue haste, or for
that matter it is a case of non-application of mind. If, the meeting of the transferee company was held on 27th February, 2009
and the reports of the experts were made ready on 2nd March, 2009 coupled with the fact that the Board of Directors approved
the proposed scheme on the same day on 2nd March, 2009, that, by itself, in my opinion, does not mean that it is a case of nonapplication of mind. The report of the valuers either prepared by Morgan Stanley or the fairness report prepared by Merrill Lynch if
read as a whole, it takes into account all the relevant factors which ought to be kept in mind to form an opinion about the swap ratio.
The valuers have indicated the approach and the basis of the amalgamation. It has referred to four possible methods that could
be borne in mind for arrival of the decision. Each method has been analysed in the report. Insofar as net asset value methodology
is concerned, it is mentioned that the valuers have computed net asset value of equity shares of both the Companies. They have
used the provisional consolidated balance sheet as at December 31, 2008 of RIL, and provisional balance sheet as at December
31, 2008 of RPL to make suitable adjustment as deemed appropriate. The valuers have adverted to the Comparable Companies’
Multiple (CCM) Method. It is noted in the report that the valuers have used Enterprises Value(EV) to EBITDA valuation multiple of
comparable listed companies for the purpose of the valuation analysis. They have then considered Historical and Current Market
Price Method which is with reference to the equity shares quoted on a Stock Exchange. Significantly, the valuers have adverted to
the exposition of the Apex Court in the case of CWT vs. Mahadev Jalan [86 ITR 621], as to the basis on which valuation of shares
needs to be done. Relevant extract of the said decision is reproduced in the valuation report itself. It then proceeds to observe that
in the present case shares of RIL and RPL are listed on BSE and NSE and there are regular transactions in their equity shares
with reasonable volumes. Keeping that in mind, the volume weighted average share price of RIL over an appropriate period was
considered for determining the value of RIL and RPL under the market price methodology. It is clearly mentioned that Discounted
cash Flows(DCF) Method was not applied in the facts of the present case. At the end, the basis of amalgamation is spelt out in the
report to give swap ration of 1:16, the same reads thus:
“BASIS OF AMALGAMATION
The basis of merger of RPL into RIL would have to be determined after taking into
consideration all the factors and methodologies as mentioned hereinabove. Though
different values have been arrived at under each of the above methodologies for
the purposes of recommending an exchange ratio of equity shares it is necessary
183
to arrive at a single value for the shares of RIL and of RPL. It is however important
to note that in doing so, we are not attempting to arrive at the absolute equity value
of RIL and RPL but at their comparative values to facilitate the determination of an
exchange ratio. For this purpose, it is necessary to given appropriate weightings
to the values arrived at under each methodology.
Since RIL is a listed company and frequently traded on BSE and NSE, we have used
Historical and Current Market Price method. We have also used sum of the parts
valuation method for RIL by valuing the operations in different business segments
by using CCM method. We have given a higher weight to the equity value of RIL
computed under Historical and Current Market Price method and sum of the parts
method. We have assigned a lower weight to the NAV method of valuation. Since
RPL is also a listed company and frequently traded on BSE and NSE, we have used
Historical and Current Market Price method and CCM method and given higher
weight to the same.
The exchange ratio of equity shares of RIL and RPL has been arrived on the basis
of a relative equity valuation for RIL and RPL based on the various methodologies
explained herein earlier and various qualitative factors relevant to each company
and the business dynamics and growth potentials of the business of the
Companies, having regard to information base, management representations and
perceptions, key underlying assumption and limitations.
In the ultimate analysis, valuation will have to be tempered by the exercise of
judicious discretion and judgment taking into account all the relevant factors.
There will always be several factors, e.g. Quality and integrity of the management,
present and prospective competition, yield on comparable securities and market
sentiment, etc., which are not evident fro the face of the balance sheets but which
will strongly influence the worth of a share. This concept is also recognized in
judicial decisions. For example, Viscount Simon Bd in Gold Coast Selection
Trust Ltd. vs. Humphrey reported in 30 TC 209 (House of Lords) and quoted with
approval by the Supreme Court of India in case reported in 176 ITR 417 as under:
“If the asset takes the form of fully paid shares, the valuation will take into
account not only the terms of the agreement but a number of other factors, such
as prospective yield, marketability, the general outlook for the type of business
of the company which has allotted the shares, the result of a contemporary
prospectus offering similar shares for subscription, the capital position of the
company, so forth. There may also be an element of value in the fact that
holding of the shares gives control of the company. If the asset is difficult to
value, but is nonetheless of a money value, the best valuation possible must
be made. Valuation is an art, not an exact science. Mathematical certainly is
not demanded, nor indeed is it possible.”
Again, it is understood that this analysis does not represent a fairness opinion.
In the light of the above, and on a consideration of all the relevant factors and
circumstances as discussed and outlined hereinabove, we consider that the
exchange ratio of equity shares for the merger of RPL into RIL should be a ratio of
1(One) equity share of RIL of Rs.10/- each fully paid up for every 16(sixteen)
equity shares of RPL of Rs.10/- each fully paid up.”
Notably, the fairness report of Merrill Lynch also refers to share valuation report submitted by Ernst & Young Morgan Stanley. On
analysing all the relevant aspects, even the Fairness Report prepared by Merrill Lynch approves the swap ratio recommended
by Morgan Stanley. It is noted that exchange ratio is fair from the financial point of view to the holders of equity shares of the
transferee company as a class. The report sets out the basis for arriving at that opinion. The report clearly mentions that the
opinion is necessarily based upon the market, economic and other conditions as they exist and can be evaluated on, and on the
information made available to the valuers as of the date of the report, including the capital structure of the Transferor Company
and Transferee Company as of the date of the report. Besides, it clearly records that they have assumed that in the course
of obtaining the necessary regulatory or other consents or approvals(contractual or otherwise) for the Merger, no restrictions,
including any divestiture requirements or amendments or modifications, will be imposed that will have material adverse effect on
the contemplated benefits of the Merger. The third report of City Group Global Market India Pvt.Ltd., copy whereof was produced,
also more or less reiterates the same position.
13. The question is: whether the experts have given their opinion without analysing the relevant matter. Looking at the report, it is not
possible to come to that conclusion. The report refers to aspects which according to the experts would require consideration for
arriving at decision regarding appropriateness of share swap ratio. It is not the case of the objectors that said considerations were
extraneous as such. Nor the objectors are in a position to point out as to how the opinion recorded by the experts regarding swap ratio
can be termed as absurd or manifestly wrong. Suffice it to observe that the reports given by the experts which were the basis to accord
approval by the Board of Directors cannot be said to suffer from the vice of non-application of mind. The fact that the entire process
was completed in short spell, may at best indicate that the Experts gave their opinion on urgent basis. We cannot be oblivious to the
fact that with the development in computer technology, the working of calculation can be programmed. If the basic figures are fed in
the computer, the calculations howsoever complicated would become readily available. Moreover, even due to the development in
communication technology on account of fax, email, video conferencing etc, communication is instant. Significantly, the Offices of
the Petitioner Company as well as of the Experts is located in Mumbai. Suffice it to observe that the Experts gave their opinion on
urgent basis presumably because of the insistence of the Petitioner Company, who in turn was keen to speed up the entire merger
process. The fairness of the scheme cannot be doubted with reference to those facts. It is not the case of the objectors that the
184
Experts’ opinion(Reports) were not placed before the Board of Directors when the decision was taken by the Board of Directors,
albeit at 10.15 a.m. the same day. In other words, the fact that on the same day, the Board of Directors proceeded to give approval
to the proposed scheme does not per se mean that the decision of the Board of Directors suffers from non-application of mind.
Nor it is possible to doubt the fairness of the Scheme merely because the Petitioner Company was keen to speed up the entire
process of amalgamation. The fact remains that the class of stakeholders got complete opportunity and information before they
took a conscious decision to approve the Scheme with requisite majority. Suffice it to note that the Board of Directors obviously
have gone by the opinion given by the experts of good standing and reputation, particularly with regard to the shares swap ratio.
Decision so taken by the Board of Directors cannot be termed as contrary to law or against the public policy. The Objectors are
not in a position to demonstrate as to how the valuation reports are unfair and to whom. They have not substantiated their plea
as to why the swap ratio determined by the Experts is wrong. No other Expert Report is relied by the Objectors to make good
that argument. Nor any legal basis is pointed out to persuade me to discard the said Valuation/Fairness Reports. If so, this Court
cannot sit over the decision of the Board of Directors and of the class of stakeholders as Court of Appeal and scrutinise the
criticism pressed into service by the Objectors disregarding the commercial wisdom of the overwhelming majority of the Equity
Shareholders as a class.
14. Insofar as the criticism with regard to the contents of the valuation report either on the ground that it does not give any forecast or
disclose any logic but only conclusion. Even this argument does not commend to me. As aforesaid, on reading the reports clause
by clause and as a whole, no fault can be found with the ultimate opinion reached by the experts regarding share swap ratio, which
is founded on tangible material and basis. I am not at all impressed by the argument of the objectors that the report is manifestation
of conflicting opinion in any manner. The fact that the language of the report would give an impression that the Expert does not take
the responsibility of the accuracy of the figures furnished to them by the Company or that they have not made any independent
valuation of the assets and liability of the companies on their own, does not mean that the relevant factors for determination of
swap ratio have not been considered by the experts. Obviously, the opinion of the Experts is based on the information provided by
the Company. There is nothing to show that the figures available in the Books of Accounts provided to the Experts were incorrect
or otherwise. Thus, there is nothing in the said Reports to indicate that the consideration weighed with the Experts in arriving at
the opinion is impermissible or unacceptable. It is not possible to countenance the grievance of the objectors that the reports
deprive the Court from basic information regarding justification of share swap ratio. As aforesaid, experts have adverted to different
methods of evaluation of shares before recording their opinion and have given justification for the ultimate conclusion reached by
them. It may be apposite to refer to the decision of the Madras High Court in the case of Kamala Sugar Mills Ltd. reported in (1984)
55 Comp Cases 308(Mad), which had occasion to consider similar criticism of the Valuation report submitted by the Experts. It went
to observe thus:
“It is not disputed that the auditors who have filed the report of the valuation
on behalf of the applicants are recognized firm of the chartered accountants.
The auditors have adopted the same method of valuation of valuing the
shares of both the companies. I do not find any reason to reject the valuation
of the auditors who have given their opinion as experts in the field of valuation.
Apart from this, Mr. U.N.R.Rao was not in a position to convincingly point out
any mistake in the valuation adopted by the auditors. Besides, the exchange
ratio has been accepted without demur by the overwhelming majority of the
 mistake in the valuation two companies.”
The above decision has been adverted to by the Apex Court in the case of Mihir H. Mafatlal(Supra), the Apex Court observed thus:
“We may also refer to a decision of the Gujarat High Court in Kamala Sugar Mills
Limited 55 Company Cases p. 308 dealing with an identical objection about the
exchange ratio adopted in the Scheme of Compromise and Arrangement. The
Court observed as under:
Once the exchange ratio of the shares of the transferee- company to be allotted to
the shareholders of the transferor- company has been worked out by recognized
firm of chartered accountants who are experts in the field of valuation and if no
mistake can be pointed out in the said valuation, it is not for the court to substitute its
exchange ratio, especially when the same has been accepted without demur by the
overwhelming majority of the shareholders of the two companies or to say that
the shareholders in their collective wisdom should not have accepted the said
exchange ratio on the ground that it will be detrimental to their interest”.
These observations in our view represent the correct legal position on this aspect.”
Even in the present case, no one has doubted the integrity and honesty of the valuers, who have given their share valuation report
or fairness report, as the case may be. Nor the objectors have been able to point out that the method adopted by the valuers was
impermissible or absurd. If so, I find no reason to discard the valuation of shares or the swap ratio determined by the Experts.
15. Insofar as the grievance made by the objectors that the experts have not reckoned the impact of the liability of the Company
in relation to the pending proceedings against the Company pertaining Gas Supply Agreement. The Petitioner in the reply filed
before this Court has stated that the facts relating to the said proceedings have been in public domain. The valuers and advisors
were aware of and took the same into account as is normally done in similar circumstances. Even if this statement appearing in
the affidavit was to be ignored as it is not supported by the contents of the Reports, in my opinion, it would make no difference.
Inasmuch as, once the valuation report is accepted, the impact due to the outcome of the pending legal proceedings cannot be
the basis to reject the scheme propounded by the Company, especially when the same has been approved by overwhelming
majority of shareholders and unanimously by the secured and unsecured creditors.
16. Even the argument of the objectors that 41% of the shares have been acquired by the group companies does not take the matter
any further. There is force in the submission made on behalf of the Petitioner that at best that is a grievance concerning misutilisation
of funds of the group company, which cannot be reckoned while considering the issue of approval of the scheme submitted under
Section 391 of the Act by the Transferee Company.
185
17. The argument of the objectors that the Company, consequent to approval of the scheme, would resort to elimination of transaction
between transferor company and Petitioner company in their Books of Account, is based on the statement appearing in the
affidavit of Regional Director. That statement however, cannot be read out of context. For, elimination of all transaction between
the transferor and transferee Company would be the natural consequence of merger. In as much as, the transaction of Transferor
Company would naturally be adjusted after the merger and would not continue to remain in the Books of Account of the Transferee
Company. Even the argument of the objectors that separate accounts of the two Companies ought to be prepared is an argument
of desperation.
18. Insofar as the apprehension of the objectors that consequent to merger, the Petitioner company would be extricated from all
pending proceedings and investigations pending before the Regulatory authority, the same is also misplaced. There is no such
provision in the present scheme. On the other hand, the pending proceedings and investigations will have to be continued and
carried to its logical end irrespective of the approval to the present scheme of merger.
19. In the circumstances, I have no hesitation in taking the view that since the petitioner Company has complied with all the statutory
requirements and formalities and the Regional Director as well as Registrar of Companies including the concerned Stock
Exchanges have given their approval/consent to the proposed scheme and the scheme not being prejudicial to any stakeholders
of the petitioner Company or public, the Petition deserves to be allowed in terms of prayer clause (a) to (g). Ordered accordingly.
20. The Petitioner in the Company Petition to pay cost of Rs. 7500/- to the Regional Director, Western Region. Costs to be paid within
four weeks from today.
21. Filing and issuance of the drawn up order is dispensed with.
22. All authorities concerned to act on a copy of this Order alongwith Scheme duly authenticated by the Company Registrar, High
Court, Bombay.
23. Counsel for the objector Mr.Shailesh Mehta prays for stay of operation of this decision for four weeks. The Petitioner has opposed
this request. However, I would accede to the request of the objector. Hence, it is ordered that this decision not to be acted upon for
four weeks from today.

Under Sections 391 To 394 of The Companies Act, 1956
OF
Reliance Petroleum Limited
(the “Transferor Company”)
WITH
Reliance Industries Limited

187
GENERAL
A. Description of Companies
I. Reliance Petroleum Limited (“RPL” or the “Transferor Company”) is a company incorporated under the Companies Act,
1956 having its Registered Office at Motikhavdi, P.O. Digvijaygram, District - Jamnagar, Gujarat - 361140, India. RPL was
formed with the objective of harnessing the emerging opportunities in the global energy sector by setting up a 5,80,000
barrels of crude oil per stream day greenfield petroleum refinery and a 0.9 million tonnes per annum polypropelene plant in a
Special Economic Zone in Jamnagar, Gujarat and has commenced refining of crude.
II. Reliance Industries Limited (“RIL” or the “Transferee Company”), is a company incorporated under the Companies Act,
1956 having its Registered Office at 3rd Floor, Maker Chambers IV, 222, Nariman Point, Mumbai - 400 021. The Transferee
Company is one of India’s largest private sector industrial enterprises in terms of net turnover, total assets, net worth and
net profit and is a Fortune 500 company. RIL ranks amongst the world’s top 10 producers for almost all its products and also
operates a 6,60,000 barrels of crude oil per stream day refinery in Jamnagar, Gujarat which is one of the largest complex
refineries globally.
III. The Transferor Company is a subsidiary of the Transferee Company.
IV. This Scheme of Amalgamation provides for the amalgamation of the Transferor Company with the Transferee Company
pursuant to Sections 391 to 394 and other relevant provisions of the Act.
B. Rationale for the Scheme
The amalgamation of the Transferor Company with the Transferee Company would inter alia have the following benefits:
(a) Greater integration and greater financial strength and flexibility for the amalgamated entity, which would result in maximising
overall shareholder value, and will improve the competitive position of the combined entity.
(b) Greater efficiency in cash management of the amalgamated entity, and unfettered access to cashflow generated by the
combined business which can be deployed more efficiently to fund organic and inorganic growth opportunities, to maximize
shareholder value.
(c) Improved organizational capability and leadership, arising from the pooling of human capital who have the diverse skills,
talent and vast experience to compete successfully in an increasingly competitive industry.
(d) Benefit of operational synergies to the combined entity in areas such as crude sourcing, product placement, freight
optimization and logistics, which can be put to the best advantage of the stakeholders.
(e) Greater leverage in operations planning and process optimization and enhanced flexibility in product slate.
(f) Cost savings are expected to flow from more focused operational efforts, rationalization, standardisation and simplification
of business processes, productivity improvements, improved procurement, and the elimination of duplication, and
rationalization of administrative expenses.
(g) Strengthened leadership in the industry, in terms of the asset base, revenues, product range, production volumes and
market share of the combined entity. The amalgamated entity will have the ability to leverage on its large asset base,
diverse range of products and services, and vast pool of intellectual capital, to enhance shareholder value.
 In view of the aforesaid, the Board of Directors of RPL as well as the Board of Directors of RIL have considered and
proposed the amalgamation of the entire undertaking and business of RPL with RIL in order to benefit the stakeholders
of both companies. Accordingly, the Board of Directors of both the companies have formulated this Scheme of
Amalgamation for the transfer and vesting of the entire undertaking and business of RPL with and into RIL pursuant to
the provisions of Section 391 to Section 394 and other relevant provisions of the Act.
